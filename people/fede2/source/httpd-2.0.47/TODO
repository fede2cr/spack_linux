Get rid of the apache (ver 1) stuff, like /etc/apache and /usr/include/apache
Make a nice little httpd.conf.dist for apache2.
Rename it httpd?
Erase the gifs?
Rename whatever necesary so that apache 1 and apache 2 can be installed on a
  box at the same time (neat for migrating to apache2).
(Details about it.
 modify rc.httpd to use apachectl2
)
