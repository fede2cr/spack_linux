To build the latest patchlevel of X11 for Slackware 11.0, use
the files in this directory to add or replace the ones that
shipped with the distribution in source/x/x11/.  Build the
packages with ./x11.SlackBuild, and then use upgradepkg to
upgrade the rebuilt packages.

The x11, x11-devel, x11-xdmx, x11-xnest, and x11-xvfb server
packages are the ones that should be upgraded.
