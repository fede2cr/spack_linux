# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|' on
# the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must make
# exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also customary to
# leave one space after the ':'.

xconvers: Xconvers is a client for convers, a IRC-like conversation\n\
xconvers: system for hamradio operators. Convers differs from IRC \n\
xconvers: because there is a much smaller command set and command \n\
xconvers: input and output is generally shorter. This is done \n\
xconvers: because a lot of convers servers are linked by radio \n\
xconvers: waves, where traffic should be kept low.\n\
