FBB is a bulletin board software package for amateur packet-radio.
FBB is developed by Jean-Paul Roubelat, F6FBB.

This binary package is made for use with a glibc2 based Slackware Linux 
distribution. It's built for Slackware 9.1.

If you intend to use the xfbbX client or the full X11 version of the FBB server
you also need to make sure that the lesstif (l series) package is installed.

Use 'pkgtool' to install or remove these from your system.
These can also be installed with 'installpkg xfbb-7.04h-i486-4.tgz'.

When your system does not yet contain the proper FBB config files then the
X11 FBB server will not start. To create the config files first start ffb from
the console.
