# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

kernel-generic: kernel-generic (a general purpose Linux kernel)
kernel-generic:
kernel-generic: This is a Linux kernel with built-in support for most IDE controllers
kernel-generic: and the ext2 filesystem.  If you need more advanced filesystems, or
kernel-generic: need to load support for a SCSI or other controller, then you'll need
kernel-generic: to load one or more kernel modules using an initial ramdisk, or
kernel-generic: initrd.  For more information about creating an initrd, see the
kernel-generic: README.initrd file in the /boot directory.
