qca: qca (Qt Cryptographic Architecture)
qca:
qca: QCA aims to provide a straightforward and cross-platform crypto API,
qca: using Qt datatypes and conventions.  QCA separates the API from the
qca: implementation, using plugins known as Providers.  The advantage of
qca: this model is to allow applications to avoid linking to or explicitly
qca: depending on any particular cryptographic library.  This allows one
qca: to easily change or upgrade crypto implementations without needing
qca: to recompile the application.
