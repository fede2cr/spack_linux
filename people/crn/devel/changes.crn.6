More installer fixups, should now install cleanly from CD and
from floppy. Serial console installs fixed. Note that vt100
compatible terminal is REQUIRED.
.boot/color-cd.gz, splack/a1/maketag.ez, splack/n1/maketag.ez,
rootdsks/color1.gz, rootdsks/color2.dsk
Jon's fix for Sparc10&20 - these will now boot OK from floppy
but if you need a CD image make your own with .boot/second.ss10-20
instead of .boot/second.b  WARNING this will not boot on Ultras.
tftp images still broken - next job.
