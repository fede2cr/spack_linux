Each kernel available in the /kernels directory has its own module set.  Please
go there to find the module you wish to load.

For example, if you are using a SPARCstation 5 (part of the sun4m family), you
would find modules for that platform in:

   /kernels/sun4dm.s/<version>

Where <version> indicates the kernel version number.
