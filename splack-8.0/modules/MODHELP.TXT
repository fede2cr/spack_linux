Using kernel modules during the installation process
----------------------------------------------------

These modules can be used to add additional hardware support before running
"setup" to install Linux.  The Configure.help file (this comes from the Linux
kernel source) explains what drivers are available for Linux.  The modules
themselves are in the directories below ./2.2.19/, and have names that are
similar to the devices they support.

To use these modules, put "insmod" (the module loading utility) on a floppy
disk along with the module(s) you need to load. After booting with a bootdisk,
loading a rootdisk (install disk), and logging in as root, make a directory
and mount the floppy disk on it:

mkdir /floppy
mount /dev/fd0 /floppy -t vfat

Then, you need to load the module.  Let's say you're loading a module to
support a 3com 3c509 ethernet card:

cd /floppy
./insmod 3c509.o

You should see a message on the screen indicating the module was loaded
successfully.  You can then unmount the floppy:

cd
umount /floppy

And, at this point you can run "setup" and install Linux.  Upon rebooting,
you'll probably want to edit /etc/rc.d/rc.modules to load the module at
boot time.

Good luck!
