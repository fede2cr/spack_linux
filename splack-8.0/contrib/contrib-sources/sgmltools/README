This is SGML tools 2.0.2 with the following changes:

- Added DocBook 3.1 and DocBook 4.0 DTDs.
- Added in the DTD and stylesheets for the GNOME Documentation Project.
  These are needed to build much of the documentation in the GTK series.
- Added collateindex.pl and db2html, which have both proven quite useful.
- Took the liberty of modifying /usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf with a few
  magic numbers.  This is needed to allow TeX to compile rather large source
  files.  Otherwise, it just dies.
