                                  (SDL)

This is the Simple DirectMedia Layer, a generic API that provides low
level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, 3D hardware via OpenGL,
and 2D framebuffer across multiple platforms.

The current version supports Linux X11, Linux framebuffer console,
Win32 GDI, Win32 DirectX, BeOS BDirectWindow, MacOS toolkit, MacOS
sprockets, FreeBSD 4.X X11, Solaris 2.X X11, and IRIX 6.X X11.

The code contains support for Linux SVGAlib, Linux GGI, Linux AAlib,
Linux DGA 2.0, OpenBSD X11, and AIX X11, but they are not yet officially
supported.

If you have a newer PC, SDL may be able to take advantage of MMX blit
acceleration using assembly routines from the Hermes blit library. :)

This library is distributed under GNU LGPL version 2, which can be
found in the file  "COPYING".  I reserve the right to place future
versions of this library under a different license.

The best way to learn how to use SDL is to check out the header files in
the "include" subdirectory and the programs in the "test" subdirectory.
The header files and test programs are well commented and always up to date.
More documentation is available in HTML format in "./docs/index.html"

The test programs in the "test" subdirectory are in the public domain.
