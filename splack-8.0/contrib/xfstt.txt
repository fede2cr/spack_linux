xfstt-1.1: A TrueType font server.

        Xfstt means "X11 Font Server for TT fonts".
        TT fonts are generally regarded to be the best scalable
        fonts for low resolution devices like displays.

        Examples where good scalable fonts improve the visual quality
        considerably are netscape(tm), gimp and java(tm).
        A fonts.properties file for use with java is provided.

        Xfstt is freely available under the LGPL. This basically means:
        Use it for free; if you fix bugs you have to contribute the
        fixes to the public.
