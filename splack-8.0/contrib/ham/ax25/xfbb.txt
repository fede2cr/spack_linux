FBB is a bulletin board software package for amateur packet-radio.
FBB is developed by Jean-Paul Roubelat, F6FBB.

This binary package is made for use with a glibc2 based Slackware Linux 
distribution. It should not be used with Slackware 4.0 or older.

If you intend to use the xfbbX client you also need to make sure that
the lesstif.tgz (diskx series) package is installed.

Use 'pkgtool' to install or remove these from your system.
These can also be installed with 'installpkg xfbb-7.03e-i386-1.tgz'.
