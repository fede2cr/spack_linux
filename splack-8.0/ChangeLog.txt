patches/packages/apache.tgz Rebuilt from SlackBuild. This upgrade takes care
  of the libmm temp file vulnerability (For detail, see: 
  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0658). Other
  changes on this package include the inclusion of the EAPI patches from
  mod_ssl-2.8.14_1.3.27, and the rights of /etc/rc.d/rc.httpd set to 644 by
  default. This last is donde so on full instalations, Apache will NOT start
  at boot by default. Upgrading to this packaga will also disable starting
  Apache at boot until you execute chmod 755 /etc/rc.d/rc.httpd.
  (* Security fix *)
patches/packages/mod_ssl.tgz:  Upgraded to mod_ssl-2.8.14_1.3.27.
  Includes RSA blinding fixes, and also fixes a bug in which an
  off-by-one error in earlier versions of mod_ssl that may allow local users
  to execute code as the Apache user. (For more information on this last
  security fix, see:
  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0653 )
  (* Security fix *)
-----------------------------------
Wed Jul 30 09:46:09 CST 2003, fede2
patches/packages/glibc.tgz:  Patched to fix a buffer overflow
  in glibc's DNS resolver functions that look up network addresses.
  Another workaround for this problem is to edit /etc/nsswtich.conf changing:
    networks:       files dns
  to:
    networks:       files
   It also includes the xdrmem_getbytes() fix.
  (* Security fix *)
patches/packages/glibcso.tgz:  Patched to fix a buffer
  overflow in glibc's DNS resolver functions that look up network addresses.
  (* Security fix *)
patches/packages/openssl.tgz, osslibs.tgz:  Upgraded to openssl-0.9.7b. This
  includes patches for the widely publicized timing attacks against SSL. We've
  seen no evidence that these attacks have occured in the wild (and suspect it
  to be unlikely), but recommend that sites using SSL upgrade.
  (* Security fix *)
patches/packages/openssh.tgz:  Upgraded to openssh-3.6.1p2.
  This version enables privilege separation by default.  The README.privsep file
  says this about it:

     Privilege separation, or privsep, is method in OpenSSH by which operations
     that require root privilege are performed by a separate privileged monitor
     process.  Its purpose is to prevent privilege escalation by containing
     corruption to an unprivileged process.  More information is available at:
       http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/ssh/privsep.html

  Therefore we recommend that all sites running the OpenSSH daemon (sshd,
  enabled by default in Splack 8.0) upgrade to this new openssh package.
  After upgrading the package, restart the daemon like this:

  /etc/rc.d/rc.sshd restart
  (* Security fix *)

patches/packages/openssh.tgz:  Upgraded to openssh-3.4p1.
  This version enables privilege separation by default.  The README.privsep file
  says this about it:

     Privilege separation, or privsep, is method in OpenSSH by which operations
     that require root privilege are performed by a separate privileged monitor
     process.  Its purpose is to prevent privilege escalation by containing
     corruption to an unprivileged process.  More information is available at:
       http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/ssh/privsep.html

  Note that ISS has released an advisory on OpenSSH (OpenSSH Remote Challenge
  Vulnerability).  Splack is not affected by this issue, as we have never
  included AUTH_BSD, S/KEY, or PAM.  Unless at least one of these options is
  compiled into sshd, it is not vulnerable.  Further note that none of these
  options are turned on in a default build from source code, so if you have
  built sshd yourself you should not be vulnerable unless you've enabled one
  of these options.

  Regardless, the security provided by privsep is unquestionably better.
  This time we (Splack) were lucky, but next time we might not be.
  Therefore we recommend that all sites running the OpenSSH daemon (sshd,
  enabled by default in Splack) upgrade to this new openssh package.
  After upgrading the package, restart the daemon like this:

  /etc/rc.d/rc.sshd restart

  We would like to thank Theo and the rest of the OpenSSH team for
  their quick handling of this issue, Niels Provos and Markus Friedl for
  implementing privsep, and Solar Designer for working out issues with
  privsep on 2.2 Linux kernels.

patches/packages/sudo.tgz:  Upgraded to sudo-1.6.6.
  This version of sudo fixes a security problem whereby a local user may gain
  root access through corruption of the heap (Off-By-Five).
  This issue was discovered by Global InterSec LLC, and more information may
  be found on their web site:
  http://www.globalintersec.com/adv/sudo-2002041701.txt
  The discussion on the site indicates that this problem may only be 
  exploitable on systems that use PAM, which Slackware does not use.
  However, in the absence of proof, it still seems prudent to upgrade 
  sudo immediately.
  (* Security fix *)

source/d/zlib/SlackBuild Cosmetic fixes.
patches/packages/zlib.tgz:  Upgraded to zlib-1.1.4.  This fixes a security
  problem which may introduce vulnerabilities into any program that links with
  zlib.  Quoting the advisory on zlib.org:

  "Depending upon how and where the zlib routines are called from the given
   program, the resulting vulnerability may have one or more of the following
   impacts: denial of service, information leakage, or execution of arbitrary
   code."

Sites are urged to upgrade the zlib package immediately.

The complete advisory may be found here:
   http://www.zlib.org/advisory-2002-03-11.txt

(* Security fix *)
patches/packages/mod_php.tgz:  Upgraded to PHP 4.1.2.

  This fixes several security problems in the POST handling code used for
  uploading files through forms.  All sites using PHP are urged to upgrade as
  soon as possible.

  A workaround for securing systems running PHP 4.0.3 or above (which
includes
  Slackware 8.0) is to add this directive to the php.ini:

  file_uploads = Off

patches/packages/openssh.tgz:  Upgraded to openssh-3.1p1.

  OpenSSH should upgrade immediately.

  All versions of OpenSSH between 2.0 and 3.0.2 contain an off-by-one error
  in the channel code.  OpenSSH 3.1 and later are not affected.  This bug can
  be exploited locally by an authenticated user logging into a vulnerable
  OpenSSH server or by a malicious SSH server attacking a vulnerable OpenSSH
  client.  This bug was discovered by Joost Pol <joost@pine.nl>

(* Security fix *)
patches/source/openssh-3.1p1/ added with source, SlackBuild and the hole
  enchilada.

  to pine4.44.

  More details from the Pine Announcement List:
    This note is to announce the availability of the Pine Message System
    version 4.44. The purpose of this release is to fix a security
    bug with the treatment of quotes in the URL-handling code. The bug
    allows a malicious sender to embed commands in a URL. This bug is
    present in all versions of UNIX Pine.

(* Security fix *)

  exploited through external services that might make use of it, like the
  port of OpenBSD's FTP server (not included in Slackware, but an example
  that's known to be affected).  It's highly recommended that internet-
  connected machines or machines with local users who might try to exploit
  setuid root binaries be upgraded as soon as possible.

  The glibc patch was obtained from Slackware' sources.

An input validation error in sendmail has been discovered by Cade Cairns of
SecurityFocus.  This problem can be exploited by local users to gain root
access.  It is not exploitable by remote attackers without shell access.

It is recommended that all multiuser sites running sendmail upgrade to these
new packages:

packages/procmail.tgz:  Upgraded to procmail-3.21.  The ChangeLog mentions
   these problems, but it's not known how serious they really are:
               - SECURITY: don't do unsafe things from signal handlers:
                  - ignore TRAP when terminating because of a signal
                  - resolve the host and protocol of COMSAT when it is set
                  - save the absolute path form of $LASTFOLDER for the comsat
                    message when it is set
                  - only use the log buffer if it's safe
packages/sendmail.tgz:  Upgraded to sendmail.8.11.6.  Removed setup for MAPS,
   since it's no longer a free service.
packages/smailcfg.tgz:  Upgraded to sendmail.8.11.6 config files.

Detailed information about this security problem may be found here:

telnetd daemon which is used in Splack.  All sites running telnet service are
advised to upgrade using one of these updated packages as soon as possible.

   fixed /usr/sbin/in.telnetd.
patches/telnetd.tgz:  A patch-package containing just the fixed
   in.telnetd binary (for faster download).
(* Security fix *)   
-----------------------------------
Thu Jan  3 11:11:53 CST 2002, fede2
/patches/ directory has been added to the Splack repository. The packages
  that will be under the /splack/ directory *must* have the same versions that
  the packages of Slackware 8.0 do have. So, the packages under this directory
  will fix the vulnerabilities that are found on a Slackware 8.0 and on a
  Splack -current system.
