A) Terms for redistributing the contents of teTeX-src-*.tar.gz or a work
   derived from it (e.g. binaries).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The software contained in the teTeX-src-*.tar.gz package is covered by
several licenses (e.g. GPL, LGPL, X license). All of them are compatible
with the requirements defined for "Open Source Software".  You have to
distribute the content of teTeX-src-*.tar.gz if you distribute binaries
from the binaries subdirectory here or from binaries that you have build
from teTeX-src-*.tar.gz.

B) Terms for redistributing the contents of teTeX-texmf-*.tar.gz.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Redistributing the files from teTeX-texmf-*.tar.gz is more complicated.
Lots of individual copyrights apply, since many people have contributed
to this collection of files.

- Some files are derived from sources in docstrip format and may only
  be redistributed together with their docstrip sources. Unless you
  want to check each individual copyright, you should distribute the
  contents of teTeX-texmfsrc-*.tar.gz if you distribute files from
  teTeX-texmf-*.tar.gz.

- Some pakages require that all files in certain subdirectories must
  be contained in a distibution of any files from that package.

- Some files don't allow to distribute changed versions or they require
  to rename changed files.

- Some files don't allow commercial use and some don't allow commercial
  distribution. So, if you plan a commercial distribution that includes
  teTeX, you should check the files in the teTeX-texmf-*.tar.gz for their
  distribution terms and leave out all files that don't allow a commercial
  distribution. Or, get in touch with the authors of packages that don't
  allow a commercial distribution and get an arrangement with them.

I admit that this makes it hard to redistribute teTeX and I'll try to
clean this up for future versions.
