Slackware aaagnome.tgz (GNOME prep package)
-------------------------------------------

This package creates a few symbolic links recommended
in the GNOME FAQ for putting GNOME in /opt:

/opt/gnome/share/aclocal -> /usr/share/aclocal
/opt/gnome/share/locale -> /usr/share/locale

We create these links before building anything in the
Slackware GTK series to ensure that things will be placed
in locations where the system will find them.

We also add this link:

/opt/gnome/etc -> /etc/opt/gnome

We've noticed that SuSE and Caldera (who also place GNOME in
/opt/gnome) have used /etc/opt/gnome as the configuration
directory.  It seems like a good idea to follow this
standard, as it should allow the use of GNOME packages
designed for these systems as well as allowing packages built
for GNOME on Slackware to work with Caldera or SuSE systems.

Two /etc/profile.d/ scripts are added to ensure users will have
/opt/gnome/bin in their $PATH and /opt/gnome/man in $MANPATH.
We also add /opt/gnome/lib to /etc/ld.so.conf.


Packages for Slackware will use these configure options:
  --prefix=/opt/gnome --sysconfdir=/etc/opt/gnome

Have fun,

   -P.
