afbinit

This program can take the afb.ucode file that comes with Solaris and load it
while you're running Linux.  This is a microcode file that has to be loaded
onto the framebuffer before any graphics acceleration will occur.  If you have
an UltraSPARC system with an Elite3D or Creator3D framebuffer, you will need
this.

To use it, simply make sure the package is installed and then copy the
/usr/lib/afb.ucode file from your Solaris filesystem to /usr/lib/afb.ucode on
your Linux filesystem.  Reboot for the microcode to be loaded.  You will notice
an extreme improvement under XFree86 after you do this.

Enjoy!
