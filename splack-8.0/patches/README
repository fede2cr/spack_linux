Splack Current - Security Patches

This directory contains patched binary packages and the source
used to create them.  All packages here refer to specific security
problems with the Current version of Splack.  To apply a patch to your
system, follow these steps:

1)  Download the necessary package and the package_descriptions
    file.

2)  Backup any configuration files that the package might
    overwrite.  To see what's in a package, use the "tar -tvzf"
    command on the package.

3)  Drop the machine into single user mode using "telinit 1".
    Make sure you're at the console, as single user mode will
    drop any network connections.  NOTE:  Some packages don't
    require you to be in runlevel 1, but it's generally a safe
    measure to go to single user for all packages.

4)  Use upgradepkg to apply the patch to the system:

       /sbin/upgradepkg <package name>

    For example, to apply a new glibcso.tgz patch to the system,
    use this command:

       /sbin/upgradepkg glibcso

5)  Go back into runlevel 3 (or 4, if were using that) using the
    "telinit 3" command.  You may also want to reboot after
    applying a patch, but that's generally not necessary.

6)  If everything is fine, you may remove the patch and description
    files that you downloaded.
