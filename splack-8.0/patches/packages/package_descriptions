procmail: The procmail mail processing program. (v3.21 2001/06/29)
procmail:
procmail: Can be used to create mail-servers, mailing lists, sort your incoming
procmail: mail into separate folders/files (real convenient when subscribing to
procmail: one or more mailing lists or for prioritising your mail), preprocess
procmail: your mail, start any programs upon mail arrival (e.g. to generate
procmail: different chimes on your workstation for different types of mail) or
procmail: selectively forward certain incoming mail automatically to someone.
