apache: Apache WWW server v 1.3.20
apache: 
apache: Apache is an HTTP server designed as a plug-in replacement for the
apache: NCSA HTTP server. It fixes numerous bugs in the NCSA server and
apache: includes many frequently requested new features, and has an API which
apache: allows it to be extended to meet users' needs more easily.
apache: 
apache: Apache is the most popular web server in the known universe; over
apache: half of the servers on the Internet are running Apache or one of
apache: its variants.
apache: 
autofs: autofs-3.1.7
autofs: 
autofs: autofs is a kernel-based automounter for Linux. It performs a job
autofs: similar to amd(8) but relies on a small stub of kernel code instead of
autofs: pretending to be an NFS server. The result is simpler code, better
autofs: reliability, and much faster operation in the common case (everything
autofs: already mounted.)

dhcp: dhcp-2.0pl5, dhcpcd-1.3.20-pl0
dhcp: 
dhcp: This package provides DHCP utilities for Linux, including both
dhcp: servers and clients. The DHCP protocol allows a host to contact a
dhcp: central server which maintains a list of IP addresses which may be
dhcp: assigned on one or more subnets. A DHCP client may request an
dhcp: address from this pool, and then use it temporarily for communication
dhcp: on the network. The DHCP protocol also provides a mechanism whereby
dhcp: a client can learn important details about the network to which it is
dhcp: attached, such as the location of a default router or name server.
