lesstif: LessTif 0.92.6
lesstif: 
lesstif: LessTif is the Hungry Programmers' (www.hungry.com) free clone of
lesstif: Motif(R). It aims to be source compatible with OSF/Motif(R) meaning
lesstif: that the same source code should compile with both and work exactly
lesstif: the same! This package contains the libraries and header files to
lesstif: be able to run and compile Motif 1.2 and 2.0 applications, along
lesstif: with the lesstif version of mwm, the Motif window manager.

xaw3d: Xaw3d-1.5
xaw3d: 
xaw3d: This is Release 1.5 (21 April, 1998) of a set of 3-D widgets by Kaleb
xaw3d: S. Keithley based on the R6.3 Athena Widget set. The Three-D Athena
xaw3d: may be used as a replacement for the Athena (Xaw) Widget set -- you
xaw3d: may relink almost any Athena Widget based application and obtain a
xaw3d: three dimensional appearance on some of the widgets. You can also
xaw3d: replace your shared libXaw with libXaw3d and obtain the three
xaw3d: dimensional appearance without even relinking.

xnest: Xnest - a nested X server.
xnest: 
xnest: Xnest is an experimental nested server for X that acts as both a
xnest: client and a server. Xnest is a client of the real server which
xnest: manages windows and graphics requests on its behalf. Xnest is a
xnest: server to its own clients. Xnest manages windows and graphics
xnest: requests on their behalf. To these clients Xnest appears to be a
xnest: conventional server.

xvfb: Virtual framebuffer X server.
xvfb: 
xvfb: Xvfb is an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
xvfb: and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb framebuffer using
xvfb: virtual memory. The primary use of this server is intended to be
xvfb: server testing. The mfb or cfb code for any depth can be exercised
xvfb: with this server without the need for real hardware that supports the
xvfb: desired depths. A secondary use is testing clients against unusual
xvfb: depths and screen configurations.
