autoconf: GNU autoconf 2.50
autoconf: 
autoconf: Autoconf is an extensible package of m4 macros that produce shell
autoconf: scripts to automatically configure software source code packages.
autoconf: These scripts can adapt the packages to many kinds of UNIX-like
autoconf: systems without manual user intervention. Autoconf creates a
autoconf: configuration script for a package from a template file that lists the
autoconf: operating system features that the package can use, in the form of m4
autoconf: macro calls.
autoconf: You must install the "m4" package to be able to use autoconf.
autoconf: 
automake: GNU automake 1.4-p2
automake: 
automake: This is automake, a Makefile generator. It was inspired by the 4.4BSD
automake: make and include files, but aims to be portable and to conform to the
automake: GNU standards for Makefile variables and targets.
automake: Automake is a Perl script. The input files are called Makefile.am.
automake: The output files are called makefile.in; they are intended for use
automake: with Autoconf. Automake requires certain things to be done in your
automake: configure.in.
automake: You must install the "m4" and "perl" packages to be able to use
automake: automake.
binutils: GNU binutils-2.10.1.0.4

binutils: Includes these development utilities:
binutils:

byacc: Berkeley Yacc
byacc: 
byacc: Berkeley Yacc is an LALR(1) parser generator. Berkeley Yacc
byacc: has been made as compatible as possible with AT&T Yacc. Berkeley
byacc: Yacc can accept any input specification that conforms to the AT&T
byacc: Yacc documentation. Specifications that take advantage of
byacc: undocumented features of AT&T Yacc will probably be rejected.
byacc: If you skip this package and install GNU Bison, a /usr/bin/yacc
byacc: shell script will be created which will allow you to use bison
byacc: instead. (It contains 'bison -y ')
byacc: 
cvs: cvs-1.11.1p1 - Concurrent Versions System
cvs: 
cvs: CVS is a version control system, which allows you to keep old versions
cvs: of files (usually source code), keep a log of who, when, and why
cvs: changes occurred, etc., like RCS or SCCS. It handles multiple
cvs: developers, multiple directories, triggers to enable/log/control
cvs: various operations, and can work over a wide area network.
cvs: 
cvs: Some of the people who have worked on CVS include: Dick Grune,
cvs: Brian Berliner, Jeff Polk, and others too numerous to mention.
cvs: 
egcs: The egcs-1.1.2 C compiler.
egcs: 
egcs: This package contains only the C compiler from egcs-1.1.2. The
egcs: recommended compiler for the kernel is egcs 1.1.2 (gcc 2.91.66), and
egcs: it should be used when you need absolute stability. You may use gcc
egcs: instead if you wish, although it may cause problems. (Quoted from the
egcs: 2.4 kernel source documentation) To use this, you'll also need to
egcs: have gcc installed (for cpp). Do not use this compiler for non-kernel
egcs: source code; it no longer works well with glibc's header files.

jpeg6: Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software version 6b
jpeg6: 
jpeg6: Software to implement JPEG image compression and decompression. JPEG
jpeg6: (pronounced 'jay-peg') is a standardized compression method for
jpeg6: full-color and gray-scale images. JPEG is intended for compressing
jpeg6: 'real-world' scenes; cartoons and other non-realistic images are not
jpeg6: its strong suit. JPEG is lossy, however, on typical images of
jpeg6: real-world scenes, very good compression levels can be obtained with
jpeg6: no visible change, and amazingly high compression levels are possible
jpeg6: if you can tolerate a low-quality image.
