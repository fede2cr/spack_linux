bash: GNU bash-2.05
bash: 
bash: The GNU Bourne-Again SHell. Bash is a sh-compatible command
bash: interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or
bash: from a file. Bash also incorporates useful features from the Korn
bash: and C shells (ksh and csh). Bash is ultimately intended to be a
bash: conformant implementation of the IEEE Posix Shell and Tools
bash: specification (IEEE Working Group 1003.2).

bzip2: bzip2 version 1.0.1 (a block-sorting file compressor)
bzip2: 
bzip2: Bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block sorting text
bzip2: compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally

bzip2: LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
bzip2: family of statistical compressors.
