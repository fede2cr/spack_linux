elisp: Emacs lisp source files.
elisp: 
elisp: This package contains source code for the parts of Emacs that are
elisp: written in Emacs Lisp. *.el files are Emacs Lisp source, and the
elisp: corresponding *.elc files are byte-compiled versions.
elisp: 
elisp: The emacsbin package contains all of the *.el files that Emacs
elisp: requires to run, but these are probably good to have if you've got
elisp: the space on your hard drive.

emac_nox: Emacs binary without X support.
emac_nox: 
emac_nox: A replacement /usr/bin/emacs binary that is not compiled with X11 menu
emac_nox: support. This version of emacs is about 400K smaller than the full
emac_nox: version of emacs, and is the same in every respect except for X11
emac_nox: extensions. It can still run in an xterm or rxvt if you wish to run
emac_nox: it under X, but it is mainly included for those folks who don't have X
emac_nox: (or the X11, Xaw, and Xt shared libs) installed on their machines.
emac_nox: You might want to remove the version that requires X if you install
emac_nox: and use this one.
