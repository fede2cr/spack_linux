a2ps: GNU a2ps-4.13b.
a2ps: 
a2ps: GNU a2ps is an Any to PostScript filter. Of course it processes
a2ps: plain text files, but also pretty prints quite a few popular
a2ps: programming languages. a2ps is used by apsfilter (apsfilt.tgz),
a2ps: so be sure to install this package if you plan to do any printing.
a2ps: Also contained in this package is psutils-1.17, a collection of
a2ps: programs for manipulating PostScript files.

apsfilter: apsfilter-6.1.1.
apsfilter: 
apsfilter: Apsfilter is a printer input filter. With apsfilter installed and
apsfilter: configured, you can print many different file types (like ASCII,
apsfilter: PostScript, and DVI, as well as compressed versions of all of these)
apsfilter: directly with 'lpr', and apsfilter will automatically handle the
apsfilter: conversion process on the fly.
apsfilter: 
apsfilter: To configure apsfilter, run the SETUP program in /usr/lib/apsfilter.
apsfilter: 
apsfilter: 
ash: Kenneth Almquist's ash shell.
ash: 
ash: A lightweight (62K) Bourne compatible shell. Great for machines with
ash: low memory, but does not provide all the extras of shells like bash,
ash: tcsh, or zsh. Runs most shell scripts compatible with the Bourne
ash: shell. Note that under Linux, most scripts seem to use at least some
ash: bash-specific syntax. The Slackware setup scripts are a notable
ash: exception, since ash is the shell used on the install disks. NetBSD
ash: uses ash as its /bin/sh.

bc: GNU bc 1.06 - An arbitrary precision calculator language.
bc: 
bc: bc is a language that supports arbitrary precision numbers with

cdparano: designed to read correct audio data even using cheap CDROM drives
cdparano: prone to misalignment, frame jitter and loss of streaming.
cdparano: Cdparanoia will also read and repair data from CDs that have been
cdparano: damaged in some way.

lvm: I/O interface in the 2.4.x kernel to get a logical view of disks.
lvm: This allows the concatenation of several disks (so-called physical
lvm: volumes or PVs) to form a storage pool (so-called Volume Group or VG)
lvm: with allocation units called physical extents (called PE). With LVM,
lvm: you can actually extend, resize, or relocate storage dynamically.
