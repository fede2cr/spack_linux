There's a lot of work to do. I you feel that you can contribute in any manner
to this distribution, please send me an e-mail.

The TODO, is not ordered by priority.

Fix install.iso
  Because I deleted the iso, I need to upload docs and jigdo files and
  templates to rebuild this iso.
  Needs documentation on how to build a reduced iso needed. Also, intel
  packages for mkisofs-silo.
  Needs some serious testing. 
  It also needs a final sync with Slackware's, but later.
Upgrading packages
  Pick up the source from slackware-8.0, modify the Slackbuild or
  equivalent, and compile. If it works properly, send in the modified
  Slackbuild.
  I suggest starting with a, n, d, or ap series. When they are done, we
  could continue with the rest. But if you would like to do gtk, kde, or x,
  your work is always welcome.
Tftp
  Make howtos that will show developers and users, how to create and modify
  tftpimages.
  The tftpconfig script needs a dialog interface.
Slackware support
  Get official answer from Patrick and David about the objectives of the
  project, and their support to us.
Beta testers
  Find beta testers for the project. Weird hardware welcome (as in you
  test it, not donate it!) ;)
Check license of several packages
  The zip utils
  XView and Java, wich are licensed to Slackware by Sun
  Pine
Documentation
  Correct references from 'Slackware' to 'Splack' where applicable.
  (This also includes references within packages on the ISO.)
  Audit all documentation and possibly rewrite some of it.
