To make a bootable Splack SPARC CD, get into the top level Splack
directory ((The one with ChangeLog.txt in it) and issue a command
like this to build the ISO image in /tmp:

mkisofs-silo -d -D -N -R -v \
  -A "Slackware Linux" \
  -S .boot/cd.b \
  -B .boot/second.b \
  -s /.boot/silo.conf \
  -o /tmp/splack.iso \
  -V "Splack Install" .

(this command will create the proper SILO bootblocks on the image)

The use 'cdrecord' to burn it.  (See 'man cdrecord')

----
notes:
  The CD must contain at least the .boot and splack directories.

  If you want to master/burn the ISO image under Windows, you're on your own.

  The "mkisofs-silo" command is only available on the SPARC port.  If you want
  to master a SPARC CD on another Linux machine, you can get the source for
  that version of mkisofs from /source/ap/mkisofs in the SPARC source tree.
