Welcome to Splack Linux (v. current)

Slackware based distribution for the Sparc arquitecture

This CD-ROM is configured to detect your archecture and load the appropriate
kernel for your system.  If you need to enter any special kernel parameters,
type "linux" (without quotes) followed by a space and then any kernel
parameters you need.

   boot: linux

If you are using a serial console, you'll need to boot using the "serial"
option.  Serial port A is configured as the default console port, but that
can be overridden with the console= setting.  If you are using serial port
B for the console, you need to pass the "console=ttyb" kernel parameter.

   boot: serial

You can use this boot CD as a rescue disk as well.  You can boot the kernel
on this disc and have it mount your root filesystem on your hard disk.  Say
you have your root filesystem on /dev/sda1:

   boot: linux root=/dev/sda1

Or, if your root filesystem is damaged, you can simply boot this CD just as
you would be installing for the first time, but mount your hard disk under
/mnt and repair it.

2.4.4 kernel option:  You can boot the 2.4.4 kernel by following the above
instructions but specifying "linux24" or "serial24" instead of "linux" or
"serial", respectively.
