<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Other implementations</A></H2>



<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Do you know of a implementation for PPP other than Linux? I would like one for HP-UX, or AIX, or ... (you fill in the blank)?</A></H2>

<P>Check the PPP FAQ document mentioned above.</P>
<P>HP-UX is supported by the commercial Morningstar
package. AIX is in the current 2.2 pppd package.</P>
<P>If you don't find one listed then post to the <EM>comp.protocols.ppp</EM>
group and not the Linux group.</P>
<P>(Please don't mail me asking for \Do you know of a PPP package
for ...\? These requests will now be \appropriately\
filed. <EM>&semi;-)</EM>)</P>
<P>The pppd package placed on sunsite does not contain
the code which would use the some of the ports which use the streams
interface. This is due to the reason that the streams interface
contains a restrictive copyright which prevents the commercial
packaging of the source which contains the module. We, the people
who have been working on the pppd package, have tried to contact
the author of the original module for streams in an attempt to
have the copyright changed. He was un-responsive at first. Now
he can not be located.</P>
<P>For this reason, and due to the fact that the sunsite
site is for Linux, I decided to remove the AIX, Next, and any
other port of pppd which involved the original streams code. The
SunOS and Solaris ports <EM>are</EM> included
since their streams implementation has been rewritten. You should
continue to find the BSD variation as well as the Linux form in
the package. If you wish the pppd code for a system which uses
streams then you will have to consult the PPP-FAQ for the location
of the pppd archive site near you. Alternately, you can use archie.
Just don't use the mirrors for sunsite as they will not have the
code.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Did you know that there is a program called \dp\?</A></H2>

<P>Yes, we know. The <EM>dp</EM>
package was considered very early in the development stage quite
a few months back. It is nice. It supports \demand dial\. It also
only works with systems which support streams. This is primarily
the SunOS (Solaris) operating systems.</P>
<P>The question of demand dial is covered later in this
document.</P>
<P>Linux, at the present time, does not supports streams.</P>
<P>There are several other packages for PPP available on the
\net\. The \portable PPP\ package is very much
like the TIA code. There is another package called simply
\PPP\. There is code for PPP in the KA9Q package.</P>
<P>The <EM>slirp</EM> and <EM>TIA</EM> code will do PPP as well.</P>
<P>Of all of the packages available, the pppd package
was the closest to the requirements and functions of Linux to
warrant the port.</P>
<P>(If you want more information about these other packages,
ask in the <EM>comp.protocols.ppp</EM> group!)</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 What RFCs describe the PPP protocol?</A></H2>

<P>The current implementation of PPP is a mixture of several.</P>
<P>The major portion of the PPP code is written against
the RFCs 1331 and 1332. These RFCs were later obsoleted. 1331
was replaced by 1548 and that, in turn, was obsoleted by 1661
six months later. Most implementations of PPP will be happy to
talk to the Linux PPP code.</P>
<P>This does not mean that the Linux PPP package is obsolete. It is only
that at the time that the package was written the current RFC was
1331. Any changes in subsequent RFC documents has been incorportated
within the pppd package and it is \current\ by today\s standards.</P>
<P>A complete list is in the faq for comp.protocols.ppp.</P>
<P>[to quote the FAQ document]:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
All of 1134, 1171, and 1172 (and 1055, for that matter
<EM>:-)</EM> have been obsoleted. They\re interesting
only if you want to debug a connection with an ancient PPP implementation,
and you\re wondering why (e.g.) it asked you for <EM>IPCP</EM>
option 2 with a length of only 4, and Compression-Type <EM>0x0037</EM>.
<P>(There\s a lot of that still running around - be careful out there.)</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Linux PPP will automatically detect these conditions and compensate for it.</P>
