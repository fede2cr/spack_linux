<P>Please send any corrections to

<P>This is but one of the Linux HOWTO/FAQ documents. You can get the
HOWTO\s from <EM>sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO</EM> (this
is the \official\ place) or via WWW from 
<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/linux.html">the Linux Documentation home page</A>. You cannot rely on the HOWTO\s being
posted to <EM>comp.os.linux.answers</EM>, as some news feeds have
complained about their size.</P>
<P>Throughout this document, I have used the word \remote\
to mean 'the system at the other end of the modem link\. It is
also called \peer\ in the PPP documentation. Another name for
this is called the \gateway\ when the term is use for routing.
Its IP address will show as the \P-t-P\ address if you use <EM>ifconfig</EM>.</P>
