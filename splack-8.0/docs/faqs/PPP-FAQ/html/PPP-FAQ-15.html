<H2><A NAME="s15">15. Other features and protocols</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss15.1">15.1 What about support for \demand dial\</A></H2>

<P>Use the <B>diald</B> package. This is on sunsite
in the same directory as the PPP source, <EM>/pub/Linux/system/Network/serial</EM>.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss15.2">15.2 What about \filtering\</A></H2>

<P>There are no plans to put filtering into the PPP
code. The 1.3 kernel supports a firewall option and you should
use that rather than attempt to find a method of putting firewall
logic into a network device driver. Use either the <EM>ipfw</EM>
or <EM>ipfwadm</EM> programs to define the
rules for the firewall code in the kernel.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss15.3">15.3 How about <EM>IPX</EM>?</A></H2>

<P>It is in the 2.2.0e package.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss15.4">15.4 How about NETBIOS?</A></H2>

<P>There is a netbios PPP protocol. However, your better
solution would be to use TCP/IP and the \<EM>samba</EM>\
code.</P>
<P>Microsoft and others have used Netbios PPP protocol.</P>
<P>The nbfcp protocol is a public document and available
from several sources. The Netbios protocol is not a valid address
family at the present time for Linux. Until Linux supports the
protocol, there is little need to support Netbios over PPP for
Linux.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss15.5">15.5 I need ISDN support. Is there any?</A></H2>

<P>ISDN support revolves around having a working ISDN
driver. The present design of the PPP driver does not lend itself
well to the concept of a block of data being received. This is
being changed. A driver for the Sonix interface is being developed.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss15.6">15.6 I would like multi-point support. Is there any support?</A></H2>

<P>Multi-point would be nice. I am not aware of anyone
working on multi-point support at the present time.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss15.7">15.7 How about just standard synchronous PPP?</A></H2>

<P>There are small changes needed to support a serial
interface which uses synchronous communications. The redesign
of the PPP driver will help with this function as well. Kate Marika
Alhola has expressed an interest in writing such a synchronous
driver for her hardware. You should contact her at kate@iti.fi
or kate@nic.funet.fi for further information.</P>
<P>She informs me that the current status of sync ppp is, that I have had
it few months in \production\ use talking with Cisco(TM) in
speeds 64K and 256K. The source is under the GPL license and it may be
found in
ftp://nic.funet.fi/pub/Linux/kernel/xnet-sync-driver-1.0.tar.gz.</P>
