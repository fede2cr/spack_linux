<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 I get compile errors when I try to compile the kernel</A></H2>

<P>This usually comes from skipping the \make kernel\ step in
the instructions. The \make kernel\ is not a sequence
telling you to build the kernel, but the actual command to be
entered. That is, issue the command for \make\ and build the
target called \kernel\.</P>
<P>There are some problems with this logic however. If you are using
Slackware 3.0, there is a bug in the \rev\ program with this
package. Before the kernel sequence may be patched properly, you must
first update the \rev\ program from the file
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/linux/slakware/a8/util.tgz">ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/linux/slakware/a8/util.tgz</A>.</P>
<P>It is very important that you do not attempt to replace any file which
this package does not replace itself. Do not attempt to force it to
replace the ppp.c driver if the \make kernel\ does not wish to do
this. There is a date stamp within the files and the files will not be
replaced if you currently have a more current version of the driver
already in the kernel.</P>
<P>Once the pieces have been installed, please rebuild
the kernel at this time. Do this even if you have previously constructed
the kernel to support PPP. The driver shipped with the 1.2 and
early 1.3 kernels is not compatible with the 2.2 version of pppd.</P>
<P>Once you have rebuilt the kernel then you may resume
to build the pppd process, chat, and pppstats.</P>
