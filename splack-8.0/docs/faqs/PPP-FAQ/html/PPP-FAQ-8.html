<H2><A NAME="s8">8. DIP</A></H2>



<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 DIP does not have support for PPP\s mode</A></H2>

<P>The current version of dip-uri supports PPP in that
it will execute the pppd process when you execute \mode PPP\.
However, there are many options which are needed for the proper
operation of pppd. Since dip does not pass these to the program,
they must be stored in the /etc/ppp/options file.</P>
<P>The dip program controls the establishment of the
SLIP link. It controls the SLIP link with the aid of slattach,
ifconfig, and route. These programs may be used to establish a
SLIP link. They are not useful for the establishment of a PPP
link.</P>
<P>The dip program may be used to dial the telephone
and start the <EM>PPP</EM> software on the
remote system. It is best used in this mode as the parameter to
the \<EM>connect</EM>\ option. However, you
have the option to use dip to control the link. It
is not important how pppd be executed to run the PPP link. It
is only important that it be executed as it is a mandatory program
for the PPP protocol.</P>
<P>While this is not a FAQ for dip, there is a common
problem with dip and pppd. The dip process has the absolute pathname
to the pppd process embedded within it. Until recently, the location
for pppd was /usr/lib/ppp/pppd. It has moved to the /usr/sbin/pppd
location. So, if you are unable to get dip to start pppd then
check the pathnames in dip.</P>
<P>Additional information about the dip process is in
the Net-2-HOWTO document.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 DIP dies immediately when I do \mode ppp\</A></H2>

<P>The location of the pppd program file is stored within dip.</P>
<P>The 2.1 version of pppd was stored in /usr/lib/ppp/pppd. The 2.2
version has moved to the more \standard\ location of
/usr/sbin/pppd. That is well and good. However, the problem is that
now dip has the wrong location for pppd. When it attempts to run the
pppd process as you do \mode ppp\, the dip program attempts
to run the pppd program and it can\t because it isn\
there.</P>
<P>You can temporarily make a symbolic link from the /usr/lib/ppp/pppd
location to the /usr/sbin/pppd file. However, a better solution is to
rebuild the dip program so that it knows that pppd is at
/usr/sbin/pppd.</P>
