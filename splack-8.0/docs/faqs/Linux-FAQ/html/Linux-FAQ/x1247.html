><P
>Yes. Linux uses the standard MS-DOS partitioning scheme, so it can
share your disk with other operating systems. </P
><P
>Linux has loadable kernel modules for (presumably) all versions of
Microsoft FAT and VFAT file systems, including Windows 2000 and 
WindowsMe.  In a correctly configured system, they should load 
automatically when the partitions are mounted.</P

compatible. DOS's <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>FDISK.EXE</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>FORMAT.EXE</TT
>, for example, can overwrite data in a
Linux partition, because they sometimes incorrectly use partition data
from the partition's boot sector rather than the partition table.</P
><P
>In order to prevent programs from doing this, it is a good idea to
zero out&#8212;under Linux&#8212;the start of a partition you created, before
