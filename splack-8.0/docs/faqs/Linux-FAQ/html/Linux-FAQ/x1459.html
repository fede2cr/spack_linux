source code). This <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>README</TT

helpful hints about IDE
drives. Many modern IDE controllers do translation between `physical'
cylinders/heads/sectors, and `logical' ones.</P
><P
>SCSI disks are accessed by linear block numbers. The BIOS invents some
`logical' cylinder/head/sector fiction to support DOS.</P
><P
>Older IBM PC-compatible BIOS's will usually not be able to access
partitions which extend beyond 1024 logical cylinders, and will make
booting a Linux kernel from such partitions using LILO problematic at
best.</P
><P
>You can still use such partitions for Linux or other operating systems
that access the controller directly.</P
><P
>It's recommend that you create at least one Linux partition entirely
under the 1024 logical cylinder limit, and boot from that. The other
partitions will then be okay.</P
><P
>Also there seems to be a bit of trouble with the newer Ultra-DMA
drives. I haven't gotten the straight scoop on them&#8212;but they are
becoming a very common problem at the SVLUG installfests. When you can
get 8 to 12 Gig drives for $200 to $300 it's no wonder.</P

uses Ext2 file system library functions and an undelete directory

may not have this feature enabled, so be sure to look in the source
code distribution for instructions on how to enable the undelete
feature.</P
