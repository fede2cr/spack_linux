></H2
><P
>Linux is the kernel of operating systems that look like and perform as
well or better than the famous operating system from AT&#38;T Bell
Labs.  Linus Torvalds and a loosely knit team of volunteer hackers
from across the Internet wrote (and still are writing) Linux from
scratch.  It has all of the features of a modern, fully fledged
operating system: true multitasking, threads, virtual memory, shared
libraries, demand loading, shared, copy-on-write executables, proper
memory management, loadable device driver modules, video frame
buffering, and TCP/IP networking.</P
><P
>Most people, however, refer to the operating system kernel, system
software, and application software, collectively, as ``Linux,'' and
that convention is used in this FAQ as well.</P
><P
>Linux was written originally for 386/486/586-based PC's, using the
hardware facilities of the 80386 processor family to implement its
features. There are now many ports to other hardware platforms.
