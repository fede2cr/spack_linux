>2.2. What Are the Reasons to Upgrade to the Version 2.4 Kernel?</A
></H2
><P
>The kernel 2.4 source code, the product of countless hours of
coding, testing, and re-coding, by dogged kernel hackers, is
being upgraded with patches and bug fixes.</P
><P
>Among the new kernel's features are: support for the IBM S/390, the
Logical Volume Manager, NFS Version 3 servers, PCMCIA CardBus devices,
USB peripherals, the Device File System, 64 GB of RAM (yes, that's
memory, not disk space), Itanium and MMX processors, drivers for many
additional hardware devices, greater maximum file sizes, and vastly
improved Symmetric Multiprocessing capabilities, at least for
certain processors.</P
><P
>The changes are more significant for non-i386 platforms, although
developers on i386 platforms can make use of the improvements&#8212;
and stumble over the incompatibilities&#8212;of the new kernel as well.</P
><P
>If there's a compelling reason to upgrade, the source code is
available, in the tar archive:
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>linux-2.4.</TT
><EM
>x</EM
><TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.tar.gz</TT
>.  (Refer to: ``<A

>Where Is the Latest Kernel Version on the Internet?</I

will likely be several months at least before the commercial vendors
upgrade their distributions to the new kernel.</P

>2.3. When Is It a Good Idea To Use the Red Hat 7.0 <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>kgcc</TT
> Compiler?</A
></H2
><P
>Red Hat Linux 7.0 ships with two compilers, GCC 2.96, and KGCC, a.k.a,
EGCS 1.1.2, a.k.a GCC 2.91.66.  Confusing?  You bet it is.  It's
probably better to use one of the standard GCC releases.  The Free
Software Foundation says that GCC 2.96, contains extensions that
produce object code which is not compatible with previous versions of
GCC, in addition to the normal bugs found in development software.
The FSF changed the version number of their current development
compiler to 2.97 to distinguish them.  The FSF's statement is at
<A
HREF="http://www.fsf.org/software/gcc/gcc-2.96.html"
TARGET="_top"
><TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>http://www.fsf.org/software/gcc/gcc-2.96.html</TT
></A
>.</P
><P
>You can determine the compiler version numbers by typing ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>gcc
--version</TT
>'' and ``<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>kgcc --version</TT
>.''  The
latest stable GCC release is 2.95.2.</P
><P
>Any recent, officially released GNU C compiler from versions 2.7.2
onward should compile the generic kernel source code, unless it's the
Version 2.4 kernel, in which case you'll need GCC 2.91.66 (EGCS
1.1.2).  Don't expect any support from the kernel developers if you're
using an earlier compiler.  </P
><P
>Does that clarify everything?</P
><P
>You can download source code distributions from one of the
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>kernel.org</TT
> mirror sites.  (Refer to: ``<A
HREF="x346.html#AEN348"
><I
>Where Is the Latest Kernel Version on the Internet?</I
></A
>,'' below.)  The
kernel source code included with Red Hat 7.0 is kernel version 2.2.16,
and is archived generically as
