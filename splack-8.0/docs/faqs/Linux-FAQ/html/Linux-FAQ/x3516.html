>11.1. Does Linux Support X?</A
></H2
><P
>Yes. Linux uses XFree86 (the current version is 4.0, which is based
on X11R6). You need to have a video card which is supported by
XFree86. See the <I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>XFree86 HOWTO</I
> for more details.

Most Linux distributions nowadays come with an X installation.
However, you can install or upgrade your own, from
<A
HREF="ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/Xfree86-*"
TARGET="_top"
><TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>"ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/Xfree86-*"</TT

and its mirror sites, or from

>11.2. How Do I Get the X Window System to Work?</A
></H2
><P
>The answers to this question can, and do, fill entire books. If the
installation program wasn't able to configure the X server correctly,
Linux will most likely try to start the X display, fail, and drop back
into text-only terminal mode.</P
><P
>First and foremost, make certain that you have provided, as closely as
possible, the correct information to the installation program of your
video hardware: the video card and monitor. Some installation programs
can correctly guess a ``least common denominator'' screen configuration,
like a 640-by-480 VESA-standard display, but there are many possible
video hardware configurations that may not be able to display this
standard.</P
><P
>The X Window System configuration file is called (usually)
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/XF86Config</TT
>, 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/X11/XF86Config</TT
>, or
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XF86Config</TT
>.</P
><P
>If you need to manually configure the X server, there are several
possible methods:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Try to use the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>XF86Setup</B
> program, which 
can help identify the
correct X server and monitor timings for the video hardware.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
> 
Make sure that the X server has the correct
options. If you log in as the superuser, you should be able to use
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>X --probeonly</TT
> to get a listing of the video card
chipset, memory, and any special graphics features. Also, refer to the
manual page for the X server. (E.g.; <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>man X</TT
>), and
try running the X server and redirecting the standard error output to
a file so you can determine, after you can view text on the screen
again, what error messages the server is generating; e.g., <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>X
2&#62;x.error</TT
>.  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>With that information, you should be able to safely refer to one
of the references provided by the Linux Documentation Project. 
("Where can I get the HOWTO's and other documentation? ")
There are several HOWTO's on the subject, including a HOWTO to
calculate video timings manually if necessary. Also, the
<I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>Installation and Getting Started</I
> guide 
has a chapter with a step-by-step guide to writing a 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>XF86Config</TT
> file.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>Also, make sure that the problem really is an incorrect 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>XF86Config</TT
>
file, not something else like the window manager failing to start. If
the X server is working correctly, you should be able to move the
mouse cursor on the screen, and pressing 
<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Ctrl</B
>-<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Alt</B
>-<B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Backspace</B
> will shut
down the X server and return to the shell prompt in one of the virtual
terminals.</P

>11.3. Where Can I Get a Ready-Made <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>XF86Config</TT
> for My System?</A
></H2
><P
>If you can't seem to get X working using the guidelines above, refer
to the <I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>XFree86 HOWTO</I
>, recent versions of 
<I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>Installation and
Getting Started</I
>, and the instructions for the 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>XF86Setup</TT
> program.

The contents of the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>XF86Config</TT
> file 
depend on the your exact
combination of video card and monitor. It can either be configured by
hand, or using the <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>XF86Setup</B
> utility. 
Read the instructions that came
with XFree86, in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/etc</TT
>. 
The file you probably need to
look at most is <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>README.Config</TT
>.

You should not use the sample <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>XF86Config.eg</TT
> 
file which is included
with newer versions of XFree86 verbatim, because the wrong video clock
settings can damage your monitor.

Please don't post to <I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>comp.os.linux.x</I
> 
asking for an <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>XF86Config</TT
>, and
please don't answer such requests.

If you have a laptop, look at the Linux Laptop Web page (``<A
HREF="x2406.html#AEN2408"
><I
>How To Find Out If a Notebook Runs Linux.</I
></A
>'')
Many of the installation notes also have the
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>XF86Config</TT
> file for the display.  If you have a
desktop machine, there are a few sample
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>XF86Config</TT

environments, and extended window managers like WindowMaker. Each uses
a different set of libraries and provides varying degrees of MS
Windows-like look and feel.</P

session-management utilities.  Several vendors have made the source
