  The Linux Distribution HOWTO
  Eric S. Raymond <esr@thyrsus.com>
  v6.9, 8 June 2000

  This document is intended to help new users choose a Linux distribu­
  tion, and to help experienced users track the state of the Linux mar­
  ket.  It does not aim to be a complete list of Linux distributions for
  all platforms, but instead focuses on leading English-language Intel
  distributions available on CD-ROM and accessible to Linux novices.

  At the request of the author, this HOWTO has been withdrawn.  A new
  one is in the process of being developed.

  Further information on Linux Distributions can be found on the Linux
  Weekly News (LWN) site: Distributions section
