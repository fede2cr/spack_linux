<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_1_2>2.</A> What is the history/design/philosophy of UltraLinux ?</FONT><P>

See 
<A HREF="http://www.nuclecu.unam.mx/~miguel/uselinux/SparcLinux.html">
The UltraLinux paper from the 1997 Uselinux conference</A> by
David Miller and Miguel de Icaza, which gives an overview from the start of
the project up to the first Linux distribution with SPARC support, Red Hat 
Linux 4.0.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_1_3>3.</A> What is up with all the names (Ultra, SPARC, S/Linux) ?</FONT><P>

A bit of history.  In the beginning the port was called SparcLinux.
Unfortunately the owners of the SPARC trademark (SPARC International)
felt that this was not a valid use of their trademark and that
customers might feel that SPARC Intl. was sponsoring or endorsing the
product in some way.  So, in order not to get sued I changed the name
on the web site to S/Linux.  When David Miller, Jakub Jelinek and
Eddie C. Dost began to develop the 64-bit port for the UltraSPARC
machines, they used the term UltraLinux. It made the most sense to call 
the project as a whole UltraLinux.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_1_4>4.</A> Why are there two ports for the SPARC, 32- and 64-bit ?</FONT><P>

Originally the port was done to 32-bit SPARC machines.  Later a kernel
was developed to exploit the 64-bit features of Sun's newer UltraSPARC
chips. Under Linux, the 32-bit SPARC architecture is known as 
&quot;sparc&quot;, and the 64-bit as &quot;sparc64&quot;. The architecture 
dependent parts for the sparc64 were included in the Linux kernel tree as 
of version 2.2.5

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_1_5>5.</A> Is everything 64-bit on sparc64, and can I compile 64-bit applications ?</FONT><P>

The kernel and kernel modules are 64-bit on sparc64, userland is still
32-bit, and in fact the same as on sparc32. The conversion between native 32-
and 64-bit function calls is being done via the kernel. Allthough you can compile 
a kernel with egcs64, you can't really use this compiler for building 64-bit 
userland binaries. See also &quot;Why can't I compile certain software on my sparc64
?&quot; in <A HREF="#s_9">Section 9</A>.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_1_6>6.</A> When will it be done ?</FONT><P>

Done implies that there is no more work to do.  In that sense it
will never be done.  There will always be more features to
add, machines to support, and better performance to be had.

On the other hand, things work quite well right now.  There are a
number of distributions available now.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_1_7>7.</A> I'm having a problem with .... What should I do ?</FONT><P>

The best thing to do when you find a problem is to send a message to
one of the mailing lists.  All of the developers read the lists and 
possibly someone else can help you.  David (and the other developers) 
are too busy to answer every email that gets sent to them.
<BR>For more information about the available mailing lists, see
<A HREF="http://www.ultralinux.org/lists.html">
http://www.ultralinux.org/lists.html</A>
<P>The <A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/SPARC-HOWTO.html">
SPARC-HOWTO</A> also provides more information on Linux on SPARC.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_1_8>8.</A> Does David Miller work on UltraLinux full-time ?</FONT><P>

Dave works for Red Hat now.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_1_9>9.</A> Will UltraLinux run regular Linux (Intel) binaries ?</FONT><P>

No.  Among other things (such as completely different processors),
Intel machines are little-endian and SPARC machines are big-endian.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_1_10>10.</A> Will UltraLinux run SunOS/Solaris binaries ?</FONT><P>

Yes, there is SunOS emulation, you will require the shared libraries
from SunOS (See the related question in the Running section).
Solaris as well as NetBSD/OpenBSD support is being worked on.  Miguel
on the Solaris emulation:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Solaris emulation is not yet finished, but will let you run small
Solaris programs (Solaris Netscape does not work for example).  You
need the <A HREF="ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/BETA/ibcs2">
ibcs2</A> package, compile it, create the devices with the script
on the package and insert the module.  You may need Solaris shared
libraries and configuration files.  Make sure you host your Solaris
stuff under /usr/gnemul/solaris
</BLOCKQUOTE>

With the newer 2.2.x kernels on sparc64, you have the option to choose 
Solaris Binary Emulation (CONFIG_SOLARIS_EMUL), which will produce a
kernel module called solaris.o<BR>
See the question in the Running section for more details.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_1_11>11.</A> How good is the SunOS/Solaris emulation ?</FONT><P>

Mhm, this one is hard to tell.  I can tell you that achieving 100%
SunOS binary compatibility is not possible without making UltraLinux
incompatible with the other ports.  We have a pretty good SunOS
emulation that should be able to run most SunOS programs though. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_1_12>12.</A> What kind of file systems does UltraLinux use ?</FONT><P>

The native file system for UltraLinux is ext2fs.  The later 2.0.x
kernels can read UFS (standard Sun) file systems.  The 2.2.x kernels
can read and write UFS partitions, which makes it easy to share
information with Solaris systems.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_1_13>13.</A> Can I share a swap partition between SunOS/Solaris and UltraLinux ?</FONT><P>

It should not be a problem at all.  The only prerequisite is that you
run &quot;mkswap /dev/sda1&quot; on that partition in your startup scripts on
the Linux installation.  This is because SunOS uses the swap as just a
raw device and doesn't have magic numbers etc. like Linux does.  So if
you didn't do the mkswap then SunOS would spam all the control
information and Linux wouldn't be able to use the swap partition
anymore.  SunOS doesn't care what is on there.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_1_14>14.</A> I heard that UltraLinux is faster then SunOS/Solaris. Is this true ?</FONT><P>

Faster is a very relative term.  UltraLinux takes a smaller amount of
memory to start up, so for machines with a small amount of memory it
will tend to seem faster.  For most low level kernel functions
UltraLinux is faster as you can see from these benchmark results:

The main reasons that Linux is faster than commercial Unices:
<P>
 
<UL> 
<LI> the system call entry is a better design.  All Unix systems
other than Linux use the design done by Bell Labs 20 years ago and the
Linux design is simply lighter - it approaches a procedure call in
cost.  The complaint is always that Linux can't possibly be supporting
all the features, such as restartable system calls, if it is that
fast.  Those claims turn out to be false - Linux supports the same
features, including security, as any commercial Unix.  It's just
designed better.  And commercial Unices are starting to pick up the
ideas.
 
<LI>Linux kernel hacks count instructions and cache misses and
eliminate them.  This is a biggy.  When each &quot;feature&quot; 
is added into a kernel, people will do gross measurement to show
that it made no difference.  
And each feature doesn't make a measurable difference - one or two
more cache misses in a code path won't show up.  But do that a 100
times and all the &quot;features&quot; taken together start to hurt.
Linux is far ahead of the rest of the world, including NT, in that
Linus and the other senior kernel folks do not kid themselves that a
cache miss here and there doesn't matter.  I frequently see the Linux
development effort keep working at it until the feature they are
working on can not go faster because it is running at hardware speeds
- there is no more room for optimization.  Contrast that with the
commercial approach of &quot;well, it didn't slow down for me&quot; and 
you can start to see how things get out of hand.  Kudos to Linus, David 
and Alan for being the smartest coders in this regard.  I'd like to be
that good.
 
<LI>Linux is a redesign.  Many ideas have been rethought using current
thinking.  All other Unix implementations (exceptions are things like
QNX - which also performs at Linux like speeds and has also been
shown to be posix/xpg4 etc compliant) are basically the same under the
covers.  It isn't surprising that fresh minds can do better - one
would hope that we have learned something in 20 years.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_2_3>3.</A> What machines do not YET run UltraLinux ?</FONT><P>

These machines are not yet supported, either due to lack of time, 
lack of access to test machines, or simply because they're very new.  
It is expected that they will be supported in the near future, 
especially the Sparcbook 3:
<UL>
   <LI>Solbourne clones
   <LI>Tadpole SPARCbooks
</UL>
The older SPARCbooks (1,2) have very different hardware and are likely to 
be difficult to support.  The newer 3 and up ones are much more standard.

The Tadpole Sparcbook 3 is now supported to the point where it will run X 
in the vger CVS tree, and soon in 2.3 kernels.

A way to run Linux on a TadPole SPARCbook 3GX is described in the
<A HREF="http://home.kabelfoon.nl/~hvdkooij/SparcBook-FAQ/sparcbook-faq.html">
SparcBook F.A.Q.</A>, by Hugo van der Kooij.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_2_4>4.</A> What Sun machines will NEVER run UltraLinux ?</FONT><P>

The Sun 3 (or for that matter the <EM>really</EM> old Sun 2 and Sun 1)
machines (such as Sun 3/50, Sun 3/60) are based on the Motorola 680x0
processor, as opposed to the SPARC processor. There is experimental 
support for Sun3 series of workstations in later Linux/m68k kernels.
<P>There is a port for the Sun 3/50, 3/60 and 3/160 machines, and can 
be found at
<A HREF="http://www.netppl.fi/~pp/sun3/">The Linux/sun3 homepages</A>
<BR>
Patches to Linux on m68k for the Sun 3/80 can be found at
<A HREF="http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~icecube/sun3x/">Linux/sun3x port
status</A>, although the page is very outdated.
<BR>
There is a mailing list for Linux/Sun3, which you can subscribe to by sending 
an email with &quot;subscribe&quot; in the body to:
<A HREF="mailto:sun3-list-request@redhat.com">sun3-list-request@redhat.com
</A>.
<BR>
The Sun i386 which is based on the Intel 80386, and not on a SPARC chip,
can't run UltraLinux nor Linux/Intel.
<P>
If you are interested in running something other than SunOS on these
machines you should take a look at the NetBSD project which also does
support some of them.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_2_5>5.</A> What about the Sun4 machines (such as 4/330) ?</FONT><P>

There are quite a few differences with the Sun4 machines vs. the
Sun4cdmu types, such as MMU, ethernet chip, disk controller and
graphics cards. There is support for sun4 in more recent kernels, allthough
the 4/330 is likely to be the only one that actually is supported.
<P>
There has been a mailing list set up for people who are interested in the Sun4 
port. This list does not seem to exist anymore, but Red Hat does have the 
intention to restore the mailing list archive in the near future.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_2_6>6.</A> Where can I find more information on older Sun hardware ?</FONT><P>

Gregory Leblanc, James Birdsall and others started a project to resurrect

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_2_8>8.</A> Can I use every Weitek POWER uP chip ?</FONT><P>

The chips with at least revision code 9518 or later are known to
work perfectly, lower revisions do not.
This code can be found in the lower right hand corner if you look
at the top of the chip. The bottom line reads eg. &quot;Weitek   9518-T&quot;,
with 9518 being the revision number. A close-up picture of this
chip can be found at the
<A HREF="http://www.auxio.org/cgi-bin/display?hardware=Weitek%20PowerUp&size=medium&view=front">

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_2_9>9.</A> Can I use ISA/PCI cards from my PC on my (Ultra)SPARC machine ?</FONT><P>

This depends on your system. If your system is Sbus based, the answer
is no. The same for ISA cards. On PCI based systems however your card can 
work if there is driver support within Linux. Known to work are
PCI SCSI cards, PCI TV cards, PCI video cards, PCI (Fast)EtherNet cards. 

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_2_10>10.</A> How can I make my JavaStation/Engine to work ?</FONT><P>

You will need a very recent 32-bit Linux kernel compiled on a SPARC machine
with several options enabled in order to get the JavaStation/Engine to boot.
There is a web page about Linux on the Sun JavaStation/Engine at
<A HREF="http://studsys.mscs.mu.edu/~dubinski/Linux_on_JS/">

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_2_11>11.</A> How can I make a Linux X-Terminal from my old SPARCstation ?</FONT><P>

You can try the SLXT package for the SPARC, available from 
<A HREF="http://www2.gol.com/users/gaijin/Linux/">
http://www2.gol.com/users/gaijin/Linux</A>. The package is still
being developed, although slowly.
<P>

can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.sfn.saskatoon.sk.ca/~aa113/sunxterm.html">
http://www.sfn.saskatoon.sk.ca/~aa113/sunxterm.html</A>.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_2_12>12.</A> Can I use the ISDN capabilities of my SPARCstation ?</FONT><P>

Unfortunately no. Several SPARCstation models, such as the SPARCstation 10, 
20, LX and Voyager, use an Sbus based DBRI chip (Dual Basic Rate ISDN),
often combined with an audio part either onboard or in a Sun SpeakerBox. 
The audio part works under Linux, but the ISDN part has not been completed.
The are no drivers known for other Sbus based ISDN cards. Probably the best
what can be done is to connect an external ISDN terminal adapter to a serial
port.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_2_13>13.</A> Is there support for audio on my SPARC ?</FONT><P>

Yes, there is (experimental) support for audio in recent kernels. 
For a complete list of supported audiodevices you can visit the
<A HREF="http://www.dementia.org/~shadow/sparcaudio.html">
Linux/SPARC audio subsystem information</A> page. 

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_2_14>14.</A> Can I select the internal speaker or line-out for audio ?</FONT><P>

You can use the program <STRONG>audioctl</STRONG> for that.
Audioctl is a utility for displaying or setting various audio system
driver variables on SPARC systems, and can be used to display or
change the settings for audio parameters like volume, sampling rate
and output device. It ships with most distributions, but the original
sourcecode for Linux can be downloaded from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dementia.org/pub/linux/sparc/audio/">

This is the original port to the sparc64 machines, based on the 32-bit 
Red Hat Linux distribution. David Miller and Jakub Jelinek 
<A HREF="http://lwn.net/1999/0429/a/up-dead.html">annouced</A> April 27th, 
1999, that they had stopped general maintenance of UltraPenguin. One of the 
reasons for this was that as most of the differences between the Red Hat 5.
distribution and UltraPenguin 1.1.9 had been merged into Red Hat 6.0, it was 
just duplicated work for them.

</B></FONT></A><BR><BR>
<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_4_1>1.</A> What operating systems can I use to build a kernel ?</FONT><P>

Except Linux itself, the only guaranteed environment is SunOS 4.1.x where x&gt;3. 
It is possible to build it under Solaris using the same tools, and Pete Zaitcev's
(zaitcev@metabyte.com) elf2aout program to convert the kernel at the end.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_4_2>2.</A> What tools do I need to compile an UltraLinux kernel from SunOS ?</FONT><P>

You will need the following tools in order to compile the kernel.
Make sure they are in your path ahead of the SunOS versions.

<UL>
   <LI>GNU binutils
   <LI>GCC 2.6.3 (later versions will most likely work, but 2.6.3
definitely does work)
   <LI>GNU bash (having it in /bin is the easiest)
   <LI>GNU make
</UL>

You can find these tools for Sun Solaris 2.3 and up at
<A HREF="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/solaris/sparc/">
http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/solaris/sparc</A>
<P>
Please note that for the newer kernels you will need GCC version
2.7.x, or 
<A HREF="http://egcs.cygnus.com">EGCS</A> 1.0.3 and up.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_4_3>3.</A> What tools do I need to compile a new kernel on an UltraSPARC ?</FONT><P>

In order to produce a 64-bit kernel for an UltraSPARC based machine (sparc64),
you will need an appropriate compiler and libraries. In this case that's egcs64,
the Experimental GNU Compiler System for sparc64. If you are not using any
distribution, the best thing to do is extract this package from one.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_4_4>4.</A> Why does the program &quot;make&quot; complain about a non-existent sparc64-linux-gcc ?</FONT><P>

You will need egcs64. See the question above.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_4_5>5.</A> Can a just grab the latest Linux source tree and compile it ?</FONT><P>

As of kernel version 2.2.5 UltraLinux (sparc and sparc64) is completely 
supported.  If you need earlier kernel versions you can get some precompiled 
versions from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.auxio.org/pub/vger/Sparc/kernel/v2.0/">
ftp://ftp.auxio.org/pub/vger/Sparc/kernel/v2.0</A>
<!---A HREF="ftp://vger.rutgers.edu/pub/linux/Sparc/kernel/v2.0/"--->
<!---ftp://vger.rutgers.edu/pub/linux/Sparc/kernel/v2.0</A>--->

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_4_6>6.</A> Where can I find the most recent kernel anyway ?</FONT><P>

You can use CVS to obtain the most recent kernel. See
<A HREF="http://vger.samba.org/">http://vger.samba.org</A> for more 
information.
<BR>CVS can be found in almost every distribution, but if you need to obtain
CVS, you can take a look at
<A HREF="http://www.sourcegear.com/CVS/">http://www.sourcegear.com/CVS</A>.
<BR>Since the SPARC development tree is synchronised with the Linus tree,
another option is to download the latest version from
<A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/">http://www.kernel.org</A>, or one of
it's mirrors. You can find all versions of the linux kernel there, including
development versions.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_4_7>7.</A> When I configure the kernel what options should I choose ?</FONT><P>

The default configuration has already been set to provide maximal
compatibility for all sparc and sparc64 machines. The default 
options are stored in <STRONG>arch/sparc[64]/defconfig</STRONG>.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_4_8>8.</A> How do I compile the kernel for UltraLinux ?</FONT><P>

Compile the kernel in the normal way (Follow the instructions in
/usr/src/linux/README), but at the end, instead of <EM>make
zImage</EM> or <EM>make zlilo</EM>, you should do
<PRE>
   <STRONG># make vmlinux</STRONG>
   <STRONG># make modules</STRONG>
   <STRONG># make modules_install</STRONG>
</PRE>

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_4_9>9.</A> What should I do after a new kernel has been compiled ?</FONT><P>

A few simple steps after the compiling of the kernel, the modules, and the
installation of the modules:
<OL>
   <LI>Copy linux/System.map to your bootfile directory (eg. /boot), and
       rename this file to System.map-&lt;kernel-version&gt;.
   <LI>Copy linux/vmlinux to your bootfile directory, and rename this file
       to vmlinux-&lt;kernel-version&gt;.
   <LI>Edit /etc/silo.conf, and add your new kernel to this file.
   <LI>Reboot your machine.
</OL>

Ofcourse there are various ways of doing this, but this way works best for me.
See also the questions about SILO in the section Booting of this FAQ.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_4_10>10.</A> Do I need to compress the kernel ?</FONT><P>

There are no size limitations on the SPARC architecture so you don't
<em>need</em> to compress (gzip or bzip2) the kernel.  It will save you 
some space at the cost of a slightly longer bootup.
The slower SPARC machines do not really like the compressed images
(zImage, bzImage).

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_4_11>11.</A> What do I need to put in the root directory ?</FONT><P>

(This is still a bit sketchy...)
<P>
In the directory that you exported the kernel from, you need to
create the directories: etc/ lib/ bin/ tmp/ dev/ sbin/ proc/ usr/ var/
<BR>
You will need to create all the devices in dev/. The <STRONG>MAKEDEV</STRONG>
script will do this (although it seems to want to be run on a Linux machine
which might create a chicken and egg problem.  
<P>
Then, check out the UltraLinux archives in:
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.auxio.org/pub/vger/Sparc/">
ftp://ftp.auxio.org/pub/vger/Sparc</A> 
<!---A HREF="ftp://vger.rutgers.edu/pub/linux/Sparc"--->
<!---ftp://vger.rutgers.edu/pub/linux/Sparc</A>--->
and grab anything that looks interesting to you.
Unpack these from the root or your exported directory
(they should fill up your usr/ sbin/ and etc/ directories.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_4_12>12.</A> What is this RPM stuff people keep talking about ?</FONT><P>

RPM is a software packaging tool, originally pushed by the Red Hat 
GNU/Linux people. It can be used to build and install software 
packages. See 
<A HREF="http://www.rpm.org/">http://www.rpm.org</A>, or the
RPM Documentation Project at
<A HREF="http://www.rpmdp.org/">http://www.rpmdp.org</A>.
<P>
If you need to get a statically linked RPM binary (so you can unpack the
latest version of RPM which itself is an RPM file) you can find
it at
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.rpm.org/pub/rpm/dist/">ftp://ftp.rpm.org/pub/rpm/dist</A>

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_4_13>13.</A> How do I set up init ?</FONT><P>

The best thing to do is grab SysVinit, for example from
<A HREF="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/daemons/init/">
http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/daemons/init</A>
<P>
Commands such as <TT>shutdown</TT> and <TT>halt</TT> can be found at
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/">
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux</A>. They used to be
part of the SysVinit package.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_4_15>15.</A> How do I get YP (NIS) working ?</FONT><P>

If you are running a recent distribution then NIS support is
compiled into the libc library.  To enable it:

<UL>
   <LI>Set the domainname for your NIS domain:<BR>
      <PRE># domainname physics.ucla</PRE>
   <LI>Edit /etc/yp.conf with the line:<BR>
      <PRE>ypserver NIS.SERVER.IP.ADDRESS<BR>ypserver 137.81.56.22</PRE>
   <LI>Edit /etc/nsswitch.conf to make sure that the correct services
    will query NIS (ie passwd, hosts, groups)  E.g.:<BR>
      <PRE>passwd:     files nis<BR>group:      files nis</PRE>

</UL>
<P>
NOTE: Always use yppasswd instead of passwd when changing your passwd
or else a little feature will happen... your locale passwd file will
be appended with the NIS passwd...

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_4_16>16.</A> What do I need to do to get X11r6 running ?</FONT><P>

You need the following:
<P>

o An X11r6 'tree' mounted under /usr/local.  I use the tree from SunOS
and mount it like:<P>
<PRE>   
   <STRONG># mount -t nfs 137.82.51.1:/share/sunos/local /usr/local</STRONG>
</PRE>
o Create the devices that X11 needs
<PRE>   
   <STRONG># mknod /dev/kbd c 11 0</STRONG>
   <STRONG># mknod /dev/sunmouse c 10 6</STRONG>
   <STRONG># mknod /dev/fb0 c 29 0</STRONG>
</PRE>
o Create a symbolic link from /dev/sunmouse to /dev/mouse.
o Create links from your graphics card (you only need the relevant
one, but having all doesn't hurt.
<PRE>	
   <STRONG># ln -s /dev/fb0 /dev/cgsix0</STRONG>

</B></FONT></A><BR><BR>
<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_1>1.</A> What is a boot prompt, and how can I get to it ?</FONT><P>

Sun *SPARC based machines have a <STRONG>OpenBoot PROM</STRONG> which takes 
control of the computer when you turn it on.  This is sort of similar to the
<STRONG>BIOS</STRONG> in a PC computer, except that the Sun boot PROMs have a 
built in Forth interpreter which lets you do quite a number of things 
with the computer without/before booting an operating system, such as
listening to the network, looking at the scsi bus, testing memory, setting the 
default boot device and setting other parameters.
<P>
In order to get to the OpenBoot PROM command line (we'll call it the <STRONG>
boot prompt (ok)</STRONG> from here), you need to hold down the <STRONG>Stop
</STRONG> key (or <STRONG>L1</STRONG> key on older type 4 keyboards) and 
simultaneously press the <STRONG>A</STRONG> key.  This will bring you to the 
prompt (usually <STRONG>ok</STRONG> but see the next question).  If there is 
an operating system running on the system, will this be <EM>suspended</EM> if 
you use this key combination.  To resume where you were type <STRONG>go
</STRONG>.
<P>
Normally you would hold <STRONG>Stop-A</STRONG> while the machine is checking
it's memory before boot time, or by typing <STRONG>halt</STRONG> from the SILO 
boot prompt if SILO is already installed.
<BR>
If you want to see or change a number of settings, you can also use the program
<STRONG>eeprom</STRONG> from a running system. It is included with Solaris, but 
Jakub Jelinek has also made a Linux version of it, included in his
<STRONG>prtconf</STRONG> package. This package can be obtained from the Red Hat
distribution source, or alternatively from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.auxio.org/pub/linux/SOURCES/">
ftp://ftp.auxio.org/pub/linux/SOURCES</A>.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_2>2.</A> Why can't I see &quot;ok&quot; at the boot prompt ?</FONT><P>

Older Sun machines default to the <STRONG>&gt;</STRONG> prompt.  You can change 
this to the <EM>new command mode</EM> by typing the letter <STRONG>n</STRONG>, 
which will give the <STRONG>ok</STRONG> prompt. If you want to make this 
permanent type:
<PRE>
   <STRONG>ok setenv sunmon-compat? false</STRONG>
</PRE>

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_3>3.</A> How can I see all the PROM parameters ?</FONT><P>

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_9>9.</A> How can I install UltraLinux software from the network ?</FONT><P>

The basic idea is this:
<UL>
   <LI> Add an entry for the new machine to the ARP/RARP cache.
   <LI> Set up a TFTP server where the bootimage can be transferred from.
   <LI> Set up a file server where you can install the software from 
   (NFS, FTP etc).
   <LI> Boot the machine and install the software.
</UL> 

Most distributions allow the client to boot via either an NFS mounted root,
or a network-loaded ramdisk where the root filesystem is being loaded in 
memory.
Be sure that server and client are allowed access to the services 
that are needed when your system is using tcp-wrappers. See also the manual 
page for hosts_access(5).

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_10>10.</A> How do I set up RARP so I can boot my Sun via the network ?</FONT><P>

This will depend on what type of machine you want to set up as a RARP
server. First of all you will need to obtain the hardware ethernet address,
which you can find on your screen when your start the machine. An example:
<PRE>
   SPARCSTATION 5, No Keyboard
   ROM Rev. 2.15 Pilot, 64 MB memory installed, Serial #1234567.
   Ethernet address <STRONG>8:0:20:1f:cd:8e</STRONG>, Host ID: 12345a9b.
</PRE>
So we now know that <STRONG>8:0:20:1f:cd:8e</STRONG> is our hardware ethernet 
address.
Under Solaris, you will need to make sure that the hardware ethernet address
for the UltraLinux machine is in the <STRONG>ethers</STRONG> database (either
/etc/ethers or via NIS/NIS+), and that it is listed in the <STRONG>hosts
</STRONG> database.  If so, simply start the RARP daemon:<BR>
<PRE>
   <STRONG># /usr/sbin/in.rarpd -a</STRONG>
</PRE>
If you want to use a machine running Linux you will need to populate the
kernel's RARP table.
You might need to use the `arp` command in addition to the `rarp` command. 
Linux used to use a single rarp/arp cache in which case you used the 
`arp` command, but now it uses separate commands so just a `rarp` should 
be sufficient.
<BR>
<PRE>
   <STRONG># /sbin/rarp -s  phoenix   08:00:20:1f:cd:8e</STRONG>
   <STRONG># /sbin/arp -s 137.82.51.3 08:00:20:1f:cd:8e</STRONG>
</PRE>

You might also need to use the hardware address with or without the padded 
0's.  For example if the hardware address is:
<TT><STRONG>8:0:20:1a:15:9e</STRONG></TT> you might also want to try
<TT><STRONG>08:00:20:1a:15:9e</STRONG></TT>
Also ensure yourself that the machine is listed in the /etc/hosts file.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_11>11.</A> ARP/RARP do not seem to be working on my boot server?</FONT><P>

If you have no support for RARP in your Linux kernel, you will either
have to compile it in, or build it as a loadable kernel module which is
called <STRONG>rarp.o</STRONG>. If you use a Linux distribution on your server,
you can try 
<PRE>
   <STRONG># modprobe rarp</STRONG>
</PRE>
The RARP kernel-module is included with most distributions by default.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_12>12.</A> My ethernet address is shown as &quot;ff:ff:ff:ff..&quot; and my machine can't boot from the network.</FONT><P>

You probably have a hardware problem and will need to replace the NVRAM.

Please see the previous question.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_14>14.</A> How do I set up a tftp server to boot from ?</FONT><P>

Under SunOS/Solaris you need to uncomment the line in your /etc/inetd.conf
file that refers to tftpboot.  It should look like
<FONT SIZE=-1>
<PRE>
<STRONG>tftp dgram udp wait root /usr/sbin/in.tftpd in.tftpd -s /tftpboot</STRONG>
</PRE></FONT>

If necessary, restart the inetd process.  You can change 
<STRONG>/tftpboot</STRONG> to a directory where you want to put the UltraLinux
bootimage.  
<P>
Under Linux, tftp does <STRONG>not</STRONG> need the &quot;-s&quot; options.
The line in /etc/inetd.conf should look something like this:
<FONT SIZE=-1><PRE>
<STRONG>tftp   dgram   udp     wait    root    /usr/sbin/tcpd  in.tftpd</STRONG>
</PRE></FONT>

After this, you will probably have to create a directory /tftpboot on your 
server, where you can place the boot image and a required symbolic link. 
(See the next question)

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_15>15.</A> What boot image will the client ask from the network ?</FONT><P>

When the client tries to boot from the network, it will ask for a file with
a special name that the boot image should have. The file name is determined 
by the IP address of the client, and by it's architecture on non-sun4u based
systems. 
<P>
This is normally done by placing the appropriate boot image in the
directory /tftpboot on the server, and then create a symbolic link with
the special file name that points to the boot image.
<P>
To find the name for the link you will have to convert the four numbers 
between the dots of the decimal IP-address into hexadecimal. You should then
put the hexadecimal figures together.
<P>
Besides calculating the numbers by hand or using a battery feeded calculator,
you have several ways of converting the IP address:
<STRONG>addr</STRONG>, which is included in the Bind (the name server) 
package, the program <STRONG>bc</STRONG>, the converter from the package 
<STRONG>ghex</STRONG>, and of course from the OpenBoot PROM of your machine.
<BR>An example of converting the IP address 172.28.230.104:
<PRE>
   172 = <STRONG>AC</STRONG>
    28 = <STRONG>1C</STRONG>
   230 = <STRONG>E6</STRONG>
   104 = <STRONG>68</STRONG>
</PRE>
With the addr utility:
<PRE>
   $ addr -p 172.28.230.104
   Input: "172.28.230.104"
   Network: [af2 len4] <STRONG>ac 1c e6 68</STRONG>
   Presentation: "172.28.230.104"
</PRE>
From the OpenBoot PROM:
<PRE>
   ok d# 172 .
   <STRONG>ac</STRONG>
   ok d# 28 .
   <STRONG>1c</STRONG>
   ok d# 230 .
   <STRONG>e6</STRONG>
   ok d# 104 .
   <STRONG>68</STRONG>
</PRE>
When put together, this will result into <STRONG>AC1CE668</STRONG>, what will
become the name of the symbolic link.
If the architecture of the client is <STRONG>not</STRONG> sun4u (UltraSPARC), 
you will have to add the systems' architecture name to the symbolic link, 
where our example would become <STRONG>AC1CE668.SUN4M</STRONG> for a 
SPARCstation 5 (sun4m).
<P>
Finally, you will have to decide what file to point the symbolic link to.
Most distributions support two ways of booting from the network:
<UL>
   <LI>Booting a kernel with an NFS-mounted root filesystem.
   <LI>Booting from a network-loaded ramdisk (mostly called tftpboot.img).
</UL>
Bootimages can be found in respectively <STRONG>images</STRONG> for Red Hat 
and Mandrake, and <STRONG>dists/&lt;release&gt;/main/disks-sparc/sun4xx</STRONG> 
for Debian.

<P>
Copy the appropriate bootfile for the clients' architecture to /tftpboot on the 
server, and create the symbolic link. For the example client above, the following
would be needed on the server for a Red Hat system:
<PRE>
   <STRONG># cp /mnt/cdrom/images/tftp32.img /tftpboot
   # cd /tftpboot
   # ln -s tftpboot.img AC1CE668.SUN4M</STRONG>
</PRE>
You will also need to ensure that the directory with the Linux installation
software or filesystem tree is being exported via NFS and that your UltraLinux 
machine will be able to mount it.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_16>16.</A> Is there an easy way to set up the network boot image structure ?</FONT><P>

Yes, you can use the <STRONG>tftptool</STRONG> utility, written in Python, 
that comes with the Red Hat distribution. It will ask you for information
about your client, and then installs the appropriate image and creates a 
symbolic link with the special name for your client. The tftptool is located 
in the <TT>utils</TT> directory of the Red Hat distribution as of version 6.1. You 
can also download this tool via one of the many 
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/mirrors.html">Red Hat mirrors</A>.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_17>17.</A> Running a tftp boot server doesn't seem to work ?</FONT><P>

First go to /tmp on your TFTP server, and try to get the bootimage via localhost:

<PRE>
   $ tftp localhost
   tftp> get AC1CE668.SUN4M
   Received 1905590 bytes in 8.3 seconds
</PRE>

If this works, you might want to check for obvious reasons why it does not work, 
such as a firewall, wrong or bad cabling etc..
<P>
Older tftp daemons for Linux only accepted requests for absolute
filenames (i.e. it had to start with a '/') which isn't what the Sun requests.
If the method above does not work, please upgrade your tftp server software to 
a more recent version.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_18>18.</A> By using what commands can I boot UltraLinux from the network ?</FONT><P>

From the boot prompt (<STRONG>ok</STRONG>), type the following for an NFS mounted root:
<PRE>
   <STRONG>ok boot net linux nfsroot=nfs.server.ip.address:/exported/path</STRONG>
</PRE>
and the following for the network-loaded ramdisk:
<PRE>
   <STRONG>ok boot net</STRONG>
</PRE>

Where <STRONG>nfs.server.ip.address</STRONG> is the IP address of the machine that 
is providing the RARP and tftpboot services, and exporting the directory
<STRONG>/exported/path</STRONG> (or whatever you called it). When no arguments for
the exported path are given, the Linux kernel will expect the NFS root path to be
<TT>/tftpboot/&lt;client.ip.address&gt;/</TT>.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_19>19.</A> My Sun doesn't seem to understand the 'boot net' command.</FONT><P>

Older Sun's default to the 'old command mode' when you are in the boot
prom.  If you get the prompt <STRONG>&gt;</STRONG> instead of <STRONG>ok</STRONG> then type
<STRONG>n</STRONG> to get the new prompt.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_20>20.</A> Booting over the network responds: &quot;receive failed: The file just loaded does not appear to be executable&quot;.</FONT><P>

Upon booting, Sun machines look for a file with the name which is the
hexadecimal representation of their IP address, followed by the machine
architecture if .  So if your IP address is 137.82.51.4 then it will try to load
the file called 89523304.SUN4M (see the question above for information
on what file the client asks for on the network.) If you are unsure
what it is trying to load try looking at wat is happening on the network.
Please see "Booting over the network still doesn't work".

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_21>21.</A> Booting over the network responds: &quot;is not executable&quot;, or: &quot;not in correct format!&quot;.</FONT><P>

Nowadays, if you have compiled the kernel sources under Solaris or Linux, the
newly built kernel will be in the ELF (Executable and Linking Format) binary
format. The PROM however will only boot the image served from the network if 
the image is in a.out (Assembler Output) binary format, which is the original
executable format for UNIX.
<P>
To convert the format from ELF into a.out you can use the program 
<TT>elftoaout</TT>.
Besides with several distributions, you can find the elftoaout utility at
<A HREF="ftp://ultra.linux.cz/OS/Linux/Sparc/local/elftoaout/">
ftp://ultra.linux.cz/OS/Linux/Sparc/local/elftoaout
or
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.auxio.org/pub/vger/Sparc/tools/">

<!---A HREF="ftp://vger.rutgers.edu/pub/linux/Sparc/tools/"--->
<!---ftp://vger.rutgers.edu/pub/linux/Sparc/tools</A>--->
If you are unsure of what type of file you have, use the command <STRONG>file
</STRONG> on the kernel image.
<P>
Be certain that if the kernel is compressed (vmlinuz name) you uncompress 
it first before using the elftoaout program. It might be necessary to add a .gz 
suffix to the filename. Again, be sure what type of file you have by using the 
<STRONG>file</STRONG> command.
<P>
Another thing to try: (this is untested, and may not even be relevant
any more!)
<P>
If you build an UltraLinux kernel on a SunOS system then you will find that a
SLC will refuse to net-boot it directly. It will say "not executable" or
something like that.
<P>
Just change the 4th byte of the file to a control-g (ascii 7) to fix
it. You can use emacs and ^Q^G to insert the control-g

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_22>22.</A> Booting over the network still doesn't work...</FONT><P>

The easiest way to debug network problems is to look at what is
happening on the network.  There is a program snoop that will display
traffic on the network.  Something like: (as root)<P>
<PRE>
   <STRONG># snoop dragon</STRONG>
</PRE>
where dragon is your UltraLinux machine.  If you have a machine
running Solaris this command is part of the operating system.
<BR>
There is also a program called <STRONG>tcpdump</STRONG> that could prove useful.
It is available via <A HREF="ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/">ftp.ee.lbl.gov</A>,
and is also included in many distributions.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_23>23.</A> How can I connect a machine for an installation via a serial cable ?</FONT><P>

Essentially, if there is no keyboard plugged in when the Sun has booted,
it will use the serial interface (port A), By default it is set to 9600bps
8,n,1  You can force the serial console from the boot 
(<STRONG>ok</STRONG>) prompt:
<PRE>
   <STRONG>ok setenv input-device ttya</STRONG>
   <STRONG>ok setenv output-device ttya</STRONG>
</PRE>

On the other (PC?) side running any terminal emulator will work
(kermit, minicom, seyon)

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_24>24.</A> When using a serial console, the installation stops after booting from the network ?</FONT><P>

Try the argument &quot;serial&quot;:
<PRE>
   <STRONG>ok boot net linux serial nfsroot=nfs.server.ip.address:/exported/path</STRONG>
</PRE>
for an NFS-mounted root filesystem, or:
<PRE>
   <STRONG>ok boot net serial</STRONG>
</PRE>
if you are booting from a network-loaded ramdisk (eg. tftpboot.img).

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_25>25.</A> Why does the system respond &quot;Inconsistent console&quot; when using a serial console ?</FONT><P>

You might want to check the NULL-modem cable from the console to the machine.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_26>26.</A> Why can't my sparc64 boot from floppy ?</FONT><P>

Due to a bug in the firmware of some Ultra based machines, booting
from the floppy drive does not work yet. In this case, you should boot
from either the CD-rom drive, of from the network.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_27>27.</A> Why can't my Ultra5/10 boot when I have more than 512 MB of memory installed ?</FONT><P>

Linux does not support more than 512 MB of memory in the 2.2.x kernels on
Ultra5 and 10 machines.

If you have more than 512 MB of physical memory installed, you really should
use a 2.4.x kernel (or remove memory boards). 

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_28>28.</A> Why does the system respond &quot;Wrong label&quot; when I reboot it after installation ?</FONT><P>

The system needs a Sun disklabel to find it's partition information.
This information is stored in the first block of the drive.
If your bootdrive doesn't contain such a disklabel, you will have to 
create it using <STRONG>fdisk</STRONG>. Within fdisk, you have the command 
<STRONG>s</STRONG>, which can be used to build a new Sun disklabel for your 
drive.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_29>29.</A> Why does the system respond &quot;Could not find /vmlinux..&quot; when I reboot it after installation ?</FONT><P>

Older machines can only boot properly when the boot image and configuration 
file are located within the first GB, and sometimes within the first 2 GB 
of it's boot disk. 
It is generally a good idea to create a separate <TT>/boot</TT> partition
under the 1GB border where the boot images and configurationfiles can be 
placed.
<TT>/etc/silo.conf</TT> should also be located under the this border, so
either create the root directory under the 1 GB border, or put silo.conf
in the <TT>/boot</TT> directory, and create a symbolic link from 
<TT>/boot/silo.conf</TT> to <TT>/etc/silo.conf</TT>. This does not apply
to sparc64, since they can read far beyond this limit.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_30>30.</A> Fdisk dies with a segfault during partitioning.</FONT><P>

You need to zero the first 5k of the disk (e.g. with dd), if the disk
doesn't contain a Sun disklabel.  fdisk could not recover from random
bits in the disklabel area, but if there were a load of zeros it would
get it and create a label. Newer versions of fdisk will complain about
the lack of a Sun disklabel, and will create a disklabel for you.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_31>31.</A> Why does the system respond &quot;Bad Magic Number in Disk Label&quot; after replacing a (boot) HDD ?</FONT><P>

You will have to run <STRONG>fdisk</STRONG> under Linux or 
<STRONG>format</STRONG> under SunOS first. This will write out a magic 
number as part of the partition table.
<BR>
Use one of the methods to boot as described above to be able to run fdisk or 
format. 

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_32>32.</A> The PROM refuses to recognize my disk.</FONT><P>

Possible solution (given in the Sun hardware reference) is to disable
&quot;synchronous negotiation initiation&quot; from the disk 
(by closing a jumper). 
Apparently the PROM gets confused if the disk initiates the negotiation.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_33>33.</A> The kernel is panicking, or refuses to boot.</FONT><P>

Make sure that you have don't have IPX packets enabled in the kernel 
configuration.
<P>

Disable 802/IPX protocols from your kernel, if you have those
enabled.  This would mean taking away the loadable kernel module from
/lib/modules or building a new kernel if they are compiled in.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_34>34.</A> Why does the system respond &quot;the file just loaded doesn't appear to be executable&quot; after installing SILO ?</FONT><P>

The SPARC machines do not really have the concept of a Master Boot
Record like on a PC. You can boot from any sector of the disk with a SPARC. 
When you install SILO on /dev/sda (block 0), you must request the PROM to boot 
from a partition that starts at 0.  The default installation FAQs advises users 
to create /dev/sda1 starting from block 1.  Therefore the partition on boot 
line must be the partition that spans the whole disk (i.e. from block 0) and 
not /dev/sda1.  If your &quot;whole disk&quot; partition is /dev/sda3 you can 
boot with &quot;boot /sbus/esp/sd@3,0:c&quot; (assuming target 3 for sda) on v2 
PROMs. I believe it would be &quot;boot sd(0,0,2)&quot; on v0 proms.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_35>35.</A> Do I need to run silo every time I change my silo.conf ?</FONT><P>

No. SILO understands ext2 filesystems and can therefore read the file 
silo.conf itself during startup to find out where the kernel you want to boot
is. This is different than LILO which does not know how to read filesystems 
and must hardcode physical disk offsets into the map loader. That is why LILO 
must always be reinstalled when lilo.conf changes.
 
<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_36>36.</A> SILO doesn't time out before booting the kernel.</FONT><P>

When you need to press enter, or enter a kernel-label each time to get 
the machine to boot, you can try the following at the boot prompt
(<STRONG>ok</STRONG>):

<PRE>
   <STRONG>ok setenv boot-file linux</STRONG>
   <STRONG>ok setenv auto-boot? true</STRONG>
</PRE>

This will set the default bootimage to be &quot;linux&quot;.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_37>37.</A> I've changed silo.conf, rebooted, and the system now responds: &quot;boot: ..wrong syntax..&quot.</FONT><P>

These are messages from SILO to say that you've done something wrong in 
silo.conf. SILO mostly tells you what to do in such a case.
<BR>
If you're not succeeding, you can still boot from disk with the following

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_5_39>39.</A> Why does my machine only boot properly when I hard-boot it  ?</FONT><P>

Older PROMS do not reset the machine on soft boots.  You can also
type <STRONG>reset</STRONG> at the boot prompt (<STRONG>ok</STRONG>) 
instead of turning off the machine.
<P>

You might also want to do the following command at the boot 
(<STRONG>ok</STRONG>) prompt:<P>
<PRE>
   <STRONG>ok setenv sunmon-compat? false</STRONG>
</PRE>

This will cause old proms to come up in the new command mode, and will allow 
the kernel to call the &quot;reset&quot; command properly for automatic 
reboots.

<P>
Karel van Houten (K.H.C.vanHouten@psi.research.kpn.com) has created a 
root/boot floppy disk set for sparc32 a while ago, which can be used as 
a rescue system when your real root disk is unbootable, a tryout 
system to see how UltraLinux works on your hardware, or (with lots of 
manual operation) to install a basic system on your hard disk.

   <LI> Networking commands to restore lost files over the network
   <LI> Uses multiple VT's

<P>
Booting a rescue image for sparc64 can only be done from a local cdrom, or 
from the network. See &quot;Why can't I boot from floppy on my sparc64&quot; 
in the section above.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_2>2.</A> Why can't I compile certain software on my sparc64 ?</FONT><P>

Certain code in your software believes that you are working on a 64-bit 
system, and will attempt to build 64-bit userland binaries. Upon linking
it turns out that you have a 32-bit userland, and it fails. SSH for one is 
known to do this. To 'fool' the software, you can use <STRONG>sparc32</STRONG> 
to create a sparc32 environment:
<PRE>
   <STRONG>$ uname -m
   sparc64
   
   $ sparc32 /bin/bash
   $ uname -m
   sparc</STRONG>
</PRE>
The sparc32 program can be obtained by installing the sparc32 RPM from the
Red Hat distribution. Alternatively you can download the source code at
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.auxio.org/pub/linux/SOURCES/">
ftp://ftp.auxio.org/pub/linux/SOURCES</A>.
   
<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_3>3.</A> How can I create a bootable CD ?</FONT><P>

There are a few ways to create a bootable CD for SPARC.
<P>The old way was to use mkisofs together with SILO (Sparc Improved Boot 
Loader). That is, if the version of SILO was lower than 0.8.7.
This worked by making an ISO image with the help of mkisofs, and then mount 
that ISO file via a loopback device. After that, SILO was run on the ISO 
filesystem in order to make the image bootable.
<P>SILO 0.8.7 and up do not longer support creating bootable CDs, and instead
you only need to use a patched version of mkisofs.
<BR>Matt Housh wrote a tutorial on 
<A HREF="http://jaeger.morpheus.net/linux/bootable-sparc-redhat-cd.html">
How To Create a Bootable Red Hat Linux 6.1 CD For a SPARC</A>.
There is also a CDROM.HOWTO included with the SILO package which explains
in detail how to create bootable CDs for SPARC. SILO can be obtained via

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_4>4.</A> How do I find out kernel state information ?</FONT><P>

The following key combinations are active while UltraLinux is running:
<P>

<STRONG>Control-ScrollLock</STRONG> - A listing of the current processes.<BR>
<STRONG>RightShift-ScrollLock</STRONG> - Memory Management information.<BR>
<STRONG>RightAltGraph-ScrollLock</STRONG> - SPARC Register Dump.<BR>

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_5>5.</A> How do I set up SunOS/Solaris emulation ?</FONT><P>

If the SunOS binary needs any shared libraries or other files they
need to placed under the following directories:<P>

/usr/gnemul/sunos/<BR>
/usr/gnemul/solaris/
<P>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> Do <STRONG>not</STRONG> just mount your SunOS or 
Solaris root directory at the above directories.  The system will then find the
wrong /dev directory and you will have problems.  UltraLinux uses
different major/minor numbers than SunOS and Solaris.
<P>
For emulation purposes the system will consider these the root
directory.  So it will look for SunOS shared libraries in
/usr/gnemul/sunos/usr/lib, and Solaris /etc files will go in
/usr/gnemul/solaris/etc
<P>
Do not ever put a Solaris or SunOS shared lib or configuration files
in /etc or /usr/lib, use the places we have provided for it.
<P>
For SunOS/Solaris emulation you will need (at a minimum):
<UL>
   <LI>/usr/gnemul/&lt;sunos or solaris&gt;/
   <UL>
      <LI>etc/ld.so.cache
      <LI>usr/lib/ld.so
      <LI>usr/lib/libdl.so.*
      <LI>usr/lib/libc*so*
      <LI>any other libraries the binary dynamically links with (use the
      &quot;ldd&quot; command to check)
   </UL>
</UL>

For Solaris emulation on non-sparc64, you will also need the iBCS package.
<P>
On sparc64 machines you can select CONFIG_SOLARIS_EMUL when 
configuring the kernel, which by default produces a loadable module 
called solaris.o. You will still need to set the directory
structure up as described above, because the module expects this.
The IBCS package is not needed when you use this kernel module.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_6>6.</A> Why do I get: &quot;crt0: no /dev/zero&quot; when running a SunOS program ?</FONT><P>

See the question above about setting up SunOS emulation.  You do not
want to mount the SunOS root directory in /usr/gnenul/sunos. If you'll do this, 
the system will find the SunOS /dev directory which will not work.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_7>7.</A> Running a SunOS executable gives: &quot;ld.so not found&quot;</FONT><P>

If the SunOS binary is dynamically linked then you will need the SunOS
shared libraries.  Copy from SunOS /usr/lib/ld.so, /usr/lib/lib*.so.*
and /etc/ld.so.cache onto your UltraLinux /usr/gnemul/sunos/usr/lib and
/usr/gnemul/sunos/etc directories.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_8>8.</A> How can I mount my Sun UFS partition read/write ?</FONT><P>

This is possible as of the 2.2.x series of Linux kernels.
First of all you will need CONFIG_UFS_FS and CONFIG_UFS_FS_WRITE enabled
in your Linux kernel.  CONFIG_UFS_FS can also be compiled as a loadable
kernel module. If you want to mount an UFS partition, your will need to
specify the <STRONG>ufstype</STRONG>, in our case <STRONG>sun</STRONG>:

<PRE>
   <STRONG># mount -t ufs -o ufstype=sun /dev/sdn8 /mnt</STRONG>
</PRE>

This will mount the under SunOS created partition with the &quot;usr&quot;
label of your <EM>n</EM>th disk to /mnt.<BR>
Please read Documentation/filesystems/ufs.txt for further reference.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_9>9.</A> Is it possible to run Netscape ?</FONT><P>

Yes, the SunOS version of Netscape will run if you set up the correct
SunOS emulation files (see the question above). You will probably also
need the SunOS version that supports DNS.<BR>
As of Netscape 4, there is a native Linux/SPARC version available.
These versions are not available anymore via Netscape's ftp sites, but
can be obtained as *.rpm files from Red Hat, or via Debian's
source packages.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_10>10.</A> The serial ports don't seem to work well.</FONT><P>

Most Sun machines (with the exception of the newer Ultra machines) do
not have a very good serial controller chip.  The maximum DTE rate is
38400 bps.  On older machines (SPARC 1 or less) this is even difficult
to maintain.
<P>
There is a hack to get the serial ports to do 76.8kb/s but this is a
very non-standard rate.
<P>
There should be no problems with the UltraSPARC models, as the internal
serial controller is capable of speeds well over 460kb/s.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_11>11.</A> Setserial reports &quot;unknown UART&quot;, or &quot;Cannot get serial info: Invalid argument&quot;.</FONT><P>

There is no reason to use setserial on SPARC machines.
If you want to set the baudbase, just use the setup from your terminal, 
set jumpers, or set it in your software (minicom/pppd/chat..).

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_12>12.</A> Why do init and getty keep complaining when there is no keyboard or monitor connected ?</FONT><P>

This can happen if you wanted to run your machine &quot;headless&quot; for instance,
and removed the keyboard after the initial installation of the software.
If this occurs your will have to edit /etc/inittab, and disable the getty's
for the console (tty1, tty2, etc.)
This can be done by removing the lines, placing a comment (#), or
changing <STRONG>respawn</STRONG> into <STRONG>off</STRONG>. 
Please don't forget to read the next question.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_13>13.</A> Why don't I get a login screen when a serial terminal is attached ?</FONT><P>

In order to get a login screen, <STRONG>getty</STRONG> should be told
that there is a terminal attached to the serial port. What getty does is
first open tty lines, print a login prompt and get the username, and
finally initiate a login process for the user. Because the tty line is
serial, change the line in /etc/inittab that reads
<PRE>
   <STRONG>1:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty1</STRONG>
   to eg.:
   <STRONG>1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty ttyS0 9600 vt100</STRONG>
</PRE>

Add that line when there is no entry yet for tty1.

Please note that the cua device is obsolete, and should only be used
with Linux 2.0.x

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_14>14.</A> Why can't I login as &quot;root&quot; on my headless machine ?</FONT><P>

You will have to add the name of the devicefile of the serial port that 
you use to login as &quot;root&quot; to /etc/securetty. This can be 
<STRONG>cua</STRONG><I>n</I> for systems that run Linux 2.0.x, and
<STRONG>ttyS</STRONG><I>n</I> for Linux 2.2.x and above, where <I>n</I>
is the portnumber.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_15>15.</A> How can I send the &quot;Stop-A&quot; key combination from a serial terminal ?</FONT><P>

The Stop-A combination is nothing more than sending a 
<STRONG>break</STRONG> signal over the serial line. In the Keyboard Set-up
menu of your terminal, or terminal emulator, you can send a break which
will halt your machine. You can also try to turn the terminal off and on.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_16>16.</A> After booting the Red Hat release, the &quot;Stop-A&quot; key combination doesn't work.</FONT><P>

This is a configurable option since the Red Hat 6.1 release. You can enable
or disable the Stop-A key combination by setting MAGIC_SYSRQ to yes or no
in /etc/sysconfig/init, or by setting <TT>kernel.stop-a = 1</TT> in
/etc/sysctl.conf. Details about it can be found in 
/usr/doc/initscripts*/sysconfig.txt.
For production machines, you way want to leave the Stop-A combination 
disabled.
<P>
From the SILO prompt at boot time, you can enter &quot;halt&quot;, which will
give you the boot <STRONG>ok</STRONG> prompt.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_17>17.</A> The parallel port doesn't work and I get an &quot;Operation not supported by device&quot;.</FONT><P>

Go into drivers/sbus/char/bpp.c in your kernel source tree, find the 
<STRONG>bpp_regs</STRONG> structure, and change all of the field declarations 
to include <STRONG>__volatile__</STRONG> at the beginning. Recompile the kernel,
install it and reboot.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_18>18.</A> After booting the Red Hat version, networking doesn't work.</FONT><P>

You probably have pcmcia support enabled.  Try:
<PRE>
   <STRONG># rm -f /etc/sysconfig/pcmcia</STRONG>
</PRE>

Then reboot or run:
<PRE>
   <STRONG># /etc/rc.d/init.d/network stop</STRONG>
   <STRONG># /etc/rc.d/init.d/network start</STRONG>
</PRE>
This problem has been fixed in later versions of Red Hat Linux.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_19>19.</A> Why won't my older program run under newer distributions ?</FONT><P>

Red Hat 5.x and 6.0 and later Debian distributions are libc6 
(a.k.a. GNU Libc 2 or glibc2) based. This is a new version of the standard 
C library which is incompatible with the libc5 that for instance Red Hat 4.2 
was based on.  
You will need to recompile your program, or get an updated package.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_20>20.</A> Why do all the network interfaces have the same hardware ethernet address ?</FONT><P>

This is a Sun feature. By default, all additional network interfaces
take the ethernet address of the embedded network interface.
This behaviour can be changed by typing the following 
at the boot prompt (<STRONG>ok</STRONG>):<P>
<PRE>
   <STRONG>ok setenv local-mac-address? true</STRONG>
</PRE>
You can also try to use <STRONG>/sbin/ifconfig</STRONG> for changing the address.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_21>21.</A> Why doesn't HTTPD start correctly on my machine ?</FONT><P>

To solve the httpd not starting problem, you need to edit /etc/hosts and
remove everything after &quot;localhost&quot; on that line.
It has probably put your full hostname there, and that's wrong.  Just
remove that part ,and *leave* the line after it.  Then you can
start httpd. 

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_22>22.</A> How can I use multiple video cards ?</FONT><P>

This works almost the same as under Solaris. From the command
line you can use the following:
<PRE>
   <STRONG>$ startx -- -dev /dev/fb0 -dev /dev/fb1</STRONG>
</PRE>

This should work for Xsun and Xsun24.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_23>23.</A> How can I get my Elite3D card to run in accelerated mode with Xsun24 ?</FONT><P>

Acceleration for these cards is disabled in most of the distributions.
In order to fix this you will need to load the microcode to the card, 
which is shipped with the driver for the Sun Elite3D graphics card.
The microcode file, called <TT>afb.ucode</TT>, can be loaded with
<TT>afbinit</TT> from Linux. 
<P>
The microcode file can be found as <TT>/usr/lib/afb.ucode</TT> under Solaris
(it is NOT shipped with the afbinit tool, but with the Solaris drivers
for the Elite3D). To obtain the afbinit tool and it's boottime init-script,
you will have to use CVS:
<PRE>
   <STRONG>$ cvs -d :pserver:cvs@vger.samba.org:/vger login</STRONG>
   (Logging in to cvs@vger.samba.org)
   CVS password: <STRONG>cvs</STRONG>
   <STRONG>$ cvs -z3 -d :pserver:cvs@vger.samba.org:/vger co afb</STRONG>
</PRE>
Now just type &quot;make&quot; in the afb directory, copy the afbinit
program to /usr/bin and make it so that the rc.afb script starts
from your init scripts. afbinit expects that the file with the microcode
to be /usr/lib/afb.ucode

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_24>24.</A> Why does the X server report: &quot;Fatal server error: ...&quot; ?</FONT><P>
 
Make sure you have write access to /dev/kbd, /dev/fb and /dev/sunmouse.
<P>
There should be a symbolic link from /dev/sunmouse to /dev/mouse for most
distributions, and make sure that in /etc/X11/XF86Config, in the Pointer
section, the Device is set to /dev/mouse.
<P>
Also make sure that /usr/bin/X11/X is linked to the proper suid root binary
(Xwrapper, Xsun, Xsun24 or Xsunmono). If you are using Xwrapper, then Xsun 
etc. should <STRONG>not</STRONG> be setuid root.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_25>25.</A> Why does the X server report &quot;Permission denied&quot; upon restarting X ?</FONT><P>

Type the following from your home-directory:
<PRE>
   <STRONG>$ rm -rf .Xauth* .xauth .ICE*</STRONG>
</PRE>
Then log out and back in, and try to start it again.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_26>26.</A> Why do I see <EM>snow</EM> when the TCX framebuffer is being accessed ?</FONT><P>

Try commenting out the following in drivers/video/tcxfb.c
<BR>
<PRE>
   #if 0
       if (prom_getbool (fb-&gt;prom_node, &quot;hw-cursor&quot;)) {
       fb-&gt;setcursor = tcx_setcursor;
       fb-&gt;setcursormap = tcx_setcursormap;
       fb-&gt;setcurshape = tcx_setcurshape;
       }
   #endif</PRE>

After this change you should rebuild the kernel, install it,  and reboot.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_27>27.</A> Xscreensaver and xlock give a white background instead of black.</FONT><P>

This is known to possibly be caused by the Window Manager you use.
<P>
For xscreensaver, open the file 
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/XScreenSaver in an editor, search
for the line that reads
<PRE>   *installColormap:    True</PRE> and set it the last part to 
<STRONG>False</STRONG>.
Also try adding the following line
<PRE>   *visualID:           PseudoColor</PRE> 
<P>
For xlock, open the file /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/XLock in
an editor, search for the line that reads
<PRE>   XLock.install:       on</PRE> and set the last part to 
<STRONG>off</STRONG>.
If the line does not exist in the file, you should add it.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_28>28.</A> X doesn't work anymore after upgrading from kernel 2.0.x to 2.2.x</FONT><P>

You are probably use a machine with a <STRONG>BWtwo</STRONG> framebuffer.
The BWtwo driver has been broken in version 2.0.37 and early 2.2.x versions 
of  the Linux kernel. There seem to be two remedies:<P>
<UL>
   <LI> Boot the older kernel that worked.
   <LI> Use Derrick J. Brashear's solution: <BR>
   Edit linux/drivers/video/bwtwofb.c, find the line which reads
   <PRE><STRONG>fb-&gt;physbase = phys;</STRONG></PRE>
   and make it read:
   <PRE><STRONG>fb-&gt;physbase = __get_phys(fb-&gt;sbdp-&gt;sbus_vaddrs[0]);</STRONG></PRE>
   Rebuild and install the new kernel, and reboot.
</UL>

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_29>29.</A> How can I stop the system starting X every time after booting ?</FONT><P>

Starting X directly after the system has booted can be a problem on 
slower SPARC machines without enough memory.
By editing the file /etc/inittab, this behaviour can be stopped.
<BR>
Boot Linux into single-user-mode by entering <STRONG>linux s</STRONG> or 
<STRONG>linux single</STRONG> at the SILO prompt.
Change the line in /etc/inittab that reads
<PRE>   <STRONG>id:5:initdefault:</STRONG></PRE>
into
<PRE>   <STRONG>id:3:initdefault:</STRONG></PRE>

See the manual page for inittab(5) for more details of this file.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_30>30.</A> X runs very slow on my older machine, what can I do ?</FONT><P>

Older machines such as the SPARCstation IPX or SPARCstation 1+ can have 
some trouble with the large size of window managers like GNOME and 
KDE. If you really want or need a window manager, you can try to 
install a lightweight window manager. A few examples are 
<A HREF="http://blackbox.alug.org">BlackBox</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.windowmaker.org">WindowMaker</A> and
the <A HREF="http://step.polymtl.ca/~coyote">OpenLook Window Manager</A>
(olwm, olvwm), also known as OpenWindows, which can also be found in the 
Debian distribution.
You can also try to start Enlightenment from your $HOME/.xinitrc file.

<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue><A NAME=q_6_31>31.</A> I have heard that I can change the OEM logo on my machine.</FONT><P>

The OEM logo is, when enabled, the picture you can see in the upper left

it's checking memory, before loading a kernel. When disabled, you can see a
Sun logo, and hardware information. 
Under Linux, you can change this into a logo of your choice by following
