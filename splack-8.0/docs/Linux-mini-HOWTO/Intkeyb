  How to setup international keyboard in X Window System with
  Xmodmap

  How to setup international keyboard in Linux or Unix with Xmodmap. The
  Xmodmap is a file that XFree86 reads in order to give you a keyboard
  layout. This solution will work for you in setting up any interna­
  tional keyboard for (Debian, RedHat, Mandrake, CorelLinux) Linux,
  FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD and possibly every Unix that uses XFree86 and
  KDE. This howto is a little experimental in that that it bypasses some
  standardized XFree86 solutions (with respect to its older versions),
  although a standard form of internationalization is included too.

  1.3.  Introduction

  The international keyboard Xmodmap HOWTO. Copyright (C) 1999, 2001
  Juraj Sipos (xvudpapc@savba.sk). Imagine you use a Linux or BSD OS and
  want to write a business letter to a person that has a foreign name
  with a slash or idiaresis. Danish language uses signs like ø and
  Spanish like ñ.



  This is the Xmodmap Howto. With this information you can make your own
  international keyboard layout without installing any additional
  packages. The following information will help you set up German,
  Spanish, Italian, Slovak, Czech, Polish, Slovenian, Croatian, Danish,
  Dutch, French, Finnish, Norwegian, Estonian, Latvian, Swedish and
  other keyboards. You can also alternatively look at my homepage at
  http://freebsd.nfo.sk to see layouts of various keyboards. In case you
  want to install Greek, Hebrew or Russian language, follow my
  information and apply changes pertinent to these languages also with
  respect to other documentation (e.g., install Greek fonts, etc., see
  the Cyrillic, Hebrew, or Danish howto). This howto does not cover the
  /etc/X11/XF86Config file XKB configuration and don't mail me with
  questions regarding this matter. There are other howtos in Linux
  Documentation project, so please look there.


  2.  Setting up international keyboard in X Window System with Xmodmap


  2.1.  Quick start

  Make your own .Xmodmap file according to information in this file.



  Alternatively, write the following in your .bash_profile in home
  directory:

  export LANG=language export LC_ALL=language

  and/or LANG=language (which can be LANG="sk_SK", for example) in your
  /etc/sysconfig/i18n file

  Here "language" is the language you want to use. The languages can be
  found in the file locale.alias in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale.  Run
  "exit" command on the console or reboot and log in again.


  Install fonts (best are ISO8859-2 Type1 fonts for Czech or Slovak),
  put them in path to your XF86Config. Start X Server.

  Please note that KDE 2.0 editors don't display ISO8859-2 fonts even if
  you have them in path. The modification of /etc/sysconfig/i18n file is
  necessary here to use the international keyboard.


  Run the command "xmodmap  /.Xmodmap" from an X terminal window to
  force the system to read the Xmodmap file.


  Switch the keyboard and enjoy.


  The other, XKB solution, which is not covered in this file but
  mentioned at least as it pertains to internationalization too, is
  another way of configuring international keyboard, and both the XKB
  and XMODMAP solutions are independent of one another. You may
  alternatively edit the /etc/X11/Xf86Config file as explained in a
  Danish Howto, or issue this command in an X terminal window for the
  Slovak keyboard:


  setxkbmap -model pc102 -symbols 'czsk(us_sk_qwertz)' setxkbmap cs
  -option grp:shift_toggle


  qwerty or qwertz means that letters z Z and y Y are swapped.  The
  "grp:shift_toggle" gives you an option to switch between keyboards.
  You may also try to write Option "XkbOptions"  "grp:ctrl_shift_toggle"
  to your XF86Config file, which will change keyboards by pressing Ctrl
  and Shift at the same time.


  To see a variety of languages (symbols), look in the file symbols.dir
  in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb directory. Note that some symbols are only
  in sources and not in binaries (of XFree86).


  As you see, this looks quite complicated too and it gets even more
  difficult when you realize that many national keymaps are not included
  in the standard XFree86 binary distribution, although they are
  included in its sources.  The kikbd utility for handling international
  keyboard layouts was removed from KDE 2.0 and documentation is quite
  insufficient. A simple way would be to start KDE, change the
  international keyboard settings and immediately write in the language
  you chose (this will work for German and other languages maybe, but in
  Eastern European keyboards some letters may not function).


  Moreover, the KDE 2.0 command "kcmshell Personalization/kcmlayout"
  will not show you a Croatian or Macedonian keyboard unless you modify
  the /etc/sysconfig/i18n file. And although it shows a Czechoslovakian
  keyboard, Czechoslovakia does not exist as a country anymore and users
  may be confused with how to define Czech or Slovak language.


  Some X Window System managers override .Xmodmap setting. If .Xmodmap
  doesn't work immediately, a good way is to force the system to read it
  from your root (home) directory. You will do this by issuing the
  following command from an X terminal window:


  xmodmap  /.Xmodmap

  After I installed the Slovak keyboard in FreeBSD 4.1 in KDE with
  Xmodmap file that used the standard definitions for ISO8859-2 keycode
  entities (lcaron, scaron, etc.), I couldn't write in Slovak or Czech,
  so I made few changes to the Xmodmap file explained later in this
  file. After applying these changes, no other changes were necessary.


  2.2.  How to do it



  2.3.  This experimental or nonstandard solution is not necessary for
  newer versions of XFree86

  Put the following in your .bash_profile:


  export LC_ALL=language

  export LANG=language

  OR

  export LC_CTYPE=sk_SK export LC_ALL=sk_SK

  OR for csh shell

  setenv LC_ALL=language setenv LANG=language

  and have the standard Xmodmap file in your home directory. If you ask
  me where you may obtain such "standard" Xmodmap files, go to GNOME
  ../share directory. The file /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/locale.alias
  contains the aliases for languages, so look there in order to find out
  what is ca_ES or br_FR, or to find out the exact syntax for your
  language (you cannot write "croatia" but you must write "croatian",
  not "Croatian"; this is very important, as Unix is case sensitive).


  Now you must install the pertinent fonts and put path in XF86Config
  file for these fonts. If you want to internationalize your keyboard,
  use the standard Xmodmap definitions first and use right alt to switch
  between keyboards (if you use GNOME Xmodmap files). If it does not
  work, do the following:

  a) Copy the "Compose" file from: /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/iso8859-2
  to: /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/iso8859-1 directory (yes, iso8859-1, not
  iso8859-2). Back up the original "Compose" file if you want
  (alternatively, copy other iso885*** Compose files to the iso8859-1
  directory).


  b) Put the included .Xmodmap file to your root directory (Slovak
  language, or make your own .Xmodmap file, or choose from the ones
  listed here).


  c) Install ISO8859-2 fonts (or other pertinent fonts).

  You may try to issue the command from X:

  xset q

  to see which fonts are in your path.

  If you want to add fonts in your path from X, issue the command:

  xset fp+ /usr/fonts_path

  xset fp rehash

  d) Disable every "Scroll Lock" uncommented line in your XF86Config,
  because our .Xmodmap for the Slovak language uses the Scroll Lock to
  switch between keyboards (you can modify this .Xmodmap for any
  keyboard).


  e) Put the appropriate fontpath for your newly installed fonts in the
  XF86Config file, if necessary (some systems may not require this, the
  FontPath "unix/:7100" may be sufficient). The .Xmodmap solution may be
  applied to all X keyboards; .Xmodmap file overrides all settings of
  keyboard layouts as defined in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb/symbols/, where
  are symbols for many international keyboards.


  First, I must say that in my solution (in older XFree86 versions),
  different mapping is used for .Xmodmap keycodes for some ISO8859-2
  keycode entities. ISO8859-2 definitions (keycode entities) like
  lcaron, zcaron actually do not work (without modification of
  /etc/sysconfig/i18n file).  This means that the ISO8859-1 definitions
  must be used instead and they will either give you what they say they
  are (aacute [á], eacute [é], etc.), or they will not give you what
  they say they are (using ISO8859-2 fonts, putting "threequarters" in
  your .Xmodmap file will not give you "3/4" but "z" with a caron, a
  reveres ^ above it). For example, "mu" will give lcaron (L'), "oslash"
  rcaron, etc.


  However, other key definitions, for example, adieresis (a with two
  dots above it), uacute (u with a slash above it), as well as
  dead_diaeresis do not require a substitution of other definitions and
  work pretty well, as they're defined everywhere (a dead key is a key
  you press, hold it, yet nothing happens, but after pressing another
  key you will get a special letter).


  The original "Compose" file in ../iso8859-1 directory can be fully
  utilized for English, Slovak or Czech keyboard layouts (Polish,
  Hungarian, Slovenian, Croatian) in some older XFree86 distributions,
  but there is only one problem - dead keys do not work. That's why you
  have to copy the "Compose" file from the iso8859-2 directory to
  iso8859-1 directory, or alternatively, you can edit the "Compose" file
  in iso8859-1 directory.


  You can leave the Keyboard section in your XF86Config file without
  much change. Put (if it's not already there) the following in the
  "Keyboard" section:

  Section "Keyboard"

  Protocol "Standard"

  XkbRules "xfree86"

  XkbModel "pc101"

  XkbLayout "us"


  Some X managers and/or environments override .Xmodmap settings, so if
  you use KDE and .Xmodmap doesn't work, force the system to read it by
  issuing the command "xmodmap  /.Xmodmap". Alternatively, you can have
  60 .Xmodmap files like .Xmo1, .Xmo2, .Xmo3, .Xmo4, etc., and you may
  force the system to read them (xmodmap  /.Xmo1). The dot means it is a
  hidden file and it is not necessary. You may also have xmo1, xmo2, or
  xmo3 Xmodmap files.


  You may write in a national keyboard only with applications that have
  access to your ISO8859-2 fonts (or other fonts), but this may not work
  with StarOffice or with other applications that have their own built-
  in fonts.  StarOffice has its own fonts directory - for afm fonts in
  StarOffice/share/xp3/fontmetrics/afm, and for ps fonts in
  StarOffice/share/xp3/pssoftfonts, so you must add the ISO8859-2 fonts
  to these directories (to tell StarOffice to use these fonts too) and
  edit fonts.dir file and add the symlinked fonts there. Here is a
  script that will do it for you. Cut it, name it "so52", make it
  executable (chmod +x so52), copy it to the StarOffice/share/xp3
  directory and execute it there.


  -------------------------------cut_here-----------------------------------
  #!/bin/sh

  STAR_OFFICE_ROOT=/StarOffice52

  FONTS_DIR=/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/ISO8859-2/Type1

  # The above fonts directory is for SuSE 7.0 and previous

  # If you have Soffice instead of StarOffice52, change the second line
  to Soffice

  # FONTS_DIR=/usr/share/fonts/ISO8859-2/Type1

  # The above fonts directory is for RedHat and Mandrake

  echo "Changes were already made."

  echo "  $XP3_DIR/psstd.fonts.il2"

  exit 1

  else

  StarOffice 5.2 fully recognizes Word97 documents even written in other
  languages, but for the older versions or other editors, you may use a
  converter from iso8859-2 to win1250 encoding.


  StarOffice 5.2 can be thus used by professional translators who may
  translate in any languages and give outputs in MS Word97 or rtf
  format.



  2.4.  Xmodmap theory and standard Xmodmap solution

  If you want to edit and make your own .Xmodmap keyboard layout
  definitions, I'll explain one line of the .Xmodmap file to make clear
  what you should do.


  This explanation can be used for all keycodes. For example, the line:

  keycode 0x11 = 8 asterisk aacute 8

  (note: keycode 0x11 is derived from the "xkeycaps" utility; you can
  also use the X "xev" utility to explore keyboard puzzles.)


  says that the first pair, the default one, (number "8" and "asterisk")
  will display number "8" when you press keycode 0x11 ("8"), will
  display asterisk when a "shift" key is pressed. After pressing the
  scroll lock, there's another definition: ISO_NEXT_GROUP, which means
  that when you press the default "8" key, no "8" will be displayed, but
  aacute ("á"); when you press the "shift" key, number "8" will be
  displayed. So if you change "aacute" and "8", anything you put instead
  of "aacute" and "8" will be displayed, for example:

  keycode 0x11 = 8 asterisk semicolon colon

  will give you "semicolon" and "colon" in your 0x11 keycode after
  pressing  the Scroll Lock.

  The ISO_NEXT_GROUP is defined by another line. If this line is not
  defined, you will be able to use only two definitions ("8" and
  "asterisk") - look at my .Xmodmap file. If you delete the
  ISO_NEXT_GROUP (the next pair of definitions on the right), you will
  have only one group of keyboard definitions ("8" and "asterisk"). Be
  careful when editing the .Xmodmap file. You mustn't delete definitions
  that enable utilization of the Scroll Lock unless you know what you
  are doing (or you map the second keyboard by right Alt). These are the
  lines such as:

  keycode 0x4e = ISO_Next_Group

  add mod5 = ISO_Next_Group,

  etc. You must also keep in mind that Unixes are case sensitive. If you
  want to find out more about keycodes, install the package "xkeycaps"
  or use "xev".

  You may find almost any xmodmap file in the GNOME directory in (SuSE)
  /opt/gnome/share/xmodmap (with standard ISO8859-1, ISO8859-2 and other
  definitions). If GNOME is not installed in the /opt directory, look in
  /usr/share. To switch between the keyboards, use right Alt. It is
  defined in these Xmodmap files already.



  2.6.  Character sets

  The purpose of the following info is to help you build any .Xmodmap
  keyboard layout with ISO8859-2 or other fonts. The ISO8859-2 Character
  Set definitions are included here for you to know which names are used
  for which keys. You should not bother about the numbers, but notice
  how keys are named. Much of this information is useful to build a
  keyboard with ISO8859-1 characters only, or a combination of Eastern
  European characters and Western characters. If you're going to use
  other languages than the Central European or Western European ones,
  find a pertinent table for your ISO*** character set on Internet. The
  gdkkeysyms.h file, that contains all the crazy names for keycode
  entities including hexcodes, is in (RedHat) /usr/include/gdk/
  directory. If no gdkkeysyms.h file is on your system, see the file
  /usr/X11R6/include/X11/keysymdef.h, or try to look in
  /lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/i386-linux/GTK/keysyms.pm (it also contains
  names of keycode entities including hex codes). If you have a newer
  version of PERL, the "5.6.0" may differ. The similar should apply to
  other systems (FreeBSD), as all these use PERL.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  First, try to see if standard definitions will give you (after
  installing pertinent fonts and building Xmodmap with keyboard
  definitions for X) what they say they are. If they will not give you
  what they say they are (some keycodes will be unfunctional), then put
  to your bash_profile the "export LANG=language" and "export
  LC_ALL=language" statements and if you are still unsuccessful, you
  must make a substitution. Definitions which will not give you what
  they say they are can be traced by their visual shape in Western Latin
  1 encoding. If you are a Czech, for example, you may issue a command:

  setxkbmap -model pc102 -symbols 'czsk(us_cz_qwertz)' setxkbmap cs
  -option grp:shift_toggle

  and see what will give you an X terminal window (press both Shift keys
  or press alt and hold it to see the other keyboard layout). This means
  that by pressing a letter "3" you will get a real "onesuperior" key.
  It is good that X terminal window does not make use of ISO8859-2 fonts
  now, so you will see what you must use instead of scaron (scaron =
  onesuperior).  By putting "onesuperior" in an .Xmodmap file you will
  get a REAL "scaron", but obviously, only with use of ISO8859-2 fonts
  (with use of ISO8859-1 fonts, you will get a REAL "onesuperior").


  Thus, the X terminal window will show you fonts like micron,
  onesuperior, threequarters, and so on. You will see what you must
  substitute. But if you don't know what "?" is called in ISO
  terminology, find and download an appropriate character set table for
  ISO8859-1, or look in gdkkeysyms.h file,
  /lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/i386-linux/GTK/keysyms.pm file, or
  ../ISO8859-1/Compose file. Alternatively, you may experiment with all
  codes defined in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/ISO8859-1/Compose file.
  You must use the ISO8859-1 entities when the system refuses to display
  the ISO8859-2 entities correctly.


  The following symbols on your right is what I found out through my
  research.  This is just an example. When you use a "Pound" definition
  in the Xmodmap file, the X will display you a Lslash instead (in
  relation to using iso8859-2 fonts, of course). When you choose some
  easy KDE text editor, select iso8859-2 fonts charset from the fonts
  menu. NOTE: vowel *acute (uacute, eacute, etc.) signs require no
  substitution, therefore I omitted iacute, aacute, etc., here.

  ISO8859-1 entity will give you the:     ISO8859-2 entity

  in our nonstandard or experimental Xmodmap keycode definition

  The example of a standard .Xmodmap file from keycode 0x31 to 0x33.
  This file will make X Server correctly display lcaron, scaron, etc.,
  if you use a newer version of XFree86 and/or have a LC_LANG=language
  and LC_ALL=language statements in your bash_profile or in
  /etc/sysconfig/i18n.  Just copy the following text from keycode 0x31
  to 0x33 to the above-listed Xmodmap file (delete the experimental
  definitions from keycode 0x31 to 0x33).


  keycode 0x31 =  grave           asciitilde      semicolon

  3.  How this Xmodmap solution works on various systems



  3.1.  SuSE


  3.1.1.  SuSE 6.4

  Everything works well with Xmodmap standard definitions. GNOME, KDE
  1.x and other X Window managers, too, nicely display ISO8859-2
  characters. No modification of other system files is required. The
  problematic here is KDE 2.0, if you install it for this system.


  3.1.2.  SuSE 7.0 with XFree86 version 3.3.6 and KDE 2.0

  No LANG=language and LC_ALL=language statements are necessary in your
  bash_profile. You may use the Xmodmap file with standard ISO8859-2
  keycode definitions (not "threequarters" but "scaron", etc.).
  Unfortunately, although you may immediately start writing with
  ISO8859-2 keycodes, the dead keys are not working properly and export
  LANG=language does not work here in order to make these dead keys
  work. Internal KDE 2.0 editors do not properly display ISO8859-2 fonts
  unless the i18n file, or its equivalent, is modified. You may also try
  to modify the KDE 2.0 settings in Preferences > Personalization >
  Country & Language, where you change the charset to ISO8859-2
  characters. Old kedit, newest GNOME's gedit and StarOffice work well
  without modification of system files. Other X Window managers like
  GNOME work well, too.

  After copying the Compose file from
  /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/iso8859-2/ to the
  /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/iso8859-1/, you may start elegantly working
  with dead keys. This was also tested on StarOffice 5.2.  The FontPath
  must be in /etc/XF86Config, not in /etc/X11/Xf86Config.

  The following is the FontPath section for ISO8859-2 fonts from my SuSE
  7.0 /etc/XF86Config file (these ISO8859-2 fonts are on your Linux CD):

  FontPath      "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/ISO8859-2/Type1"

  FontPath      "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/ISO8859-2/Type1/afm"

  FontPath      "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/ISO8859-2/Type1/pfm"



  3.2.  Mandrake Linux


  3.2.1.  Mandrake Linux 7.2 with KDE 2.0

  GNOME and other X Window managers work well even without modification
  of /etc/sysconfig/i18n file. KDE 2.0 is a little bit harder, as this
  file needs to be modified. I used the "kcmshell
  Personalization/kcmlayout" command, (or go to menu Configuration > KDE
  > Personalization > keyboard layout) to select the keyboard, and after
  putting the LANG=language in the /etc/sysconfig/i18n file (and
  rebooting afterwards), KDE 2.0 works nicely and StarOffice works
  immediately (with ISO8859-2 fonts in its directory) with dead keys. I
  chose Czechoslovakian as the second language and could write in Czech
  with ISO8859-2 characters on my screen even without the Xmodmap file.
  However, after using the Xmodmap file (standard definitions), I could
  use the Slovak keyboard layout.

  The following is my Mandrake /etc/sysconfig/i18n file (I commented the
  previous definitions for English):

  #LC_MONETARY=en_US

  The maps in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb/symbols can be modified on the fly
  while in X; you only switch keyboards from the panel (clicking on
  icon).  You can edit those maps and modify them for your choice. After
  changing some Czech definitions in the "cs" file to Slovak ones
  StarOffice displayed them well.



  3.3.  RedHat


  3.3.1.  RedHat 5.1, 5.2, 6.0, 6.1 and 6.2 (XFree86 3.3.6 and older)

  No LANG=language and LC_ALL=language statements are necessary in your
  bash_profile. Here the "experimental" .Xmodmap solution works well
  ("mu" instead of "lcaron", etc., unless you modify the
  /etc/sysconfig/i18n file; then you may try to use the "standard"
  entities) and you must copy the Compose file from ../IS08859-2 to
  ../ISO8859-1 directory to make dead keys work. The XF86Config file may
  remain untouched.


  3.3.2.  RedHat 7.0 with KDE 2.0 and XFree86 4.x

  GNOME and other X Window managers work well. You do not have to copy
  the Compose file from ../ISO8859-2 to ../ISO8859-1 directory. KDE 1.x
  works well, too, but KDE 2.0 requires modification of
  /etc/sysconfig/i18n file.  The following is syntax of my i18n file
  from RedHat 7.0:

  LANG="sk_SK"

  I changed nothing in the Menu in Preferences > Personalization except
  that I added the additional keyboard (Czechoslovakian) layout. Please
  note that some other systems may require a different attitude.  The
  following is the syntax from my KDE kxkbrc file in
  /root/.kde/share/config directory: [Layout]

  Additional=cs

  AdditionalEncodings=ISO8859-2

  Encoding=ISO8859-1

  Layout=us

  Model=pc104

  Test=Test

  Use=true

  However, this file is generated automatically after you add a keyboard
  layout.



  3.4.  FreeBSD


  3.4.1.  FreeBSD 3.1 and 3.2

  Same as with RedHat 5.1, 5.2, 6.0, 6.1, 6.2.


  3.4.2.  FreeBSD 4.1

  No LANG=language and LC_ALL=language statements are necessary in your
  bash_profile. However, you can use two strategies:

  a) either you modify the /etc/profile file and put there a statement
  like: LANG=sk_SK.ISO8859-2; export LANG

  After you reboot, you will have a Slovak keyboard in KDE immediately
  and you can use the right Alt key to use ISO8859-1 keycodes. But dead
  keys will not work and you have to copy the ../ISO8859-2/Compose file
  to ../ISO8859-1 directory to make them work. Irritating may be using
  the right Alt to switch to keycodes like "@", if you use an email
  client often, for example.

  b) Same strategy as for FreeBSD 3.1, 3.2 with nonstandard xmodmap
  definitions and copying the ../ISO8859-2/Compose file to ../ISO8859-1
  directory.



  3.5.  Corel Linux


  3.5.1.  Corel Linux 1.0 and 1.2

  Same as with FreeBSD.



  4.  Some national Xmodmap files

  Please note: I am not the author of these files and don't mail me if
  you find something incorrect in them. These files were taken from the
  GNOME distribution and the main focus of this howto is to tell you how
  to map various keycode entities, so that you can make your own
  keyboard layouts.  Use right Alt to switch the keyboard.

  5.  Some Xmodmap tips

  If you want to list the current keymap table, issue the command:
  xmodmap -pk | more

  The xkeycaps program is a sort of graphical front-end for xmodmap.
  Start it and see which numbers mean which keycode.

  To make the mouse buttons left-handed, use a command: xmodmap -e
  "pointer = 3 2 1"

  To remove the CapsLock and change it to control key, write this in
  your Xmodmap file:
  remove Lock = Caps_Lock keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L add Control =
  Control_L
