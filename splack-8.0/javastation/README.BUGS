Known bugs for the JavaStation.

1) /proc/openprom and /dev/openprom do not exist.
	This is caused by limitations in PROLL18.
	prtconf and similar utilities will not work.

2) /dev/audio and /dev/sound/* appear correctly for Mrcoffee 
	but not for Krups.
	This is a kernel problem which will probably be fixed 
	in the (hopefully near) future.
