tftpconfig
Utility for setting up a TFTP boot server on a Slackware Linux system.

This is a Bourne shell script that will aid in setting up an existing Slackware
system to be a boot server to install Slackware on a SPARC system.  It's pretty
straightforward.  You will need the MAC address of your SPARC system, the IP
you want to assign it, and the boot image you want to use.  Tftpconfig is an
interactive script, so it will ask for that information.
