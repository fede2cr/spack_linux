Updated splack/a/silo* to 1.4.8
Updated boot with new silo stuff
NOTE I had to cobble this together because parts of silo-1.4.8 will not
 compile so I downloaded silo-loaders-1.4.8.tar.gz binaries and hacked it.
 Someone will need to fixup sources/a/silo later.
Added iso/beta.iso - this is a bootable CD image which works for 32 and 64 bit
 systems.

Copied splack/a/aaa_base-10.0.0-noarch-1.tgz from Slackware 10
also devs-2.3.1-noarch-21.tgz and hotplug-2004_01_05-noarch-3.tgz
deleted splack/a/devfs* (we need to have udev eventually)
Put the correct 64 bit kernel into splack/a/kernel-2.4.27-sparc-1.tgz (oops)
We can now do a clean install without devfs screwing it up.

Forked a beta tree to get the install kit moving.
Later changes to the official tree may not be included.
kernels/* all new 2.4.27
a/kernel-2.4.27-sparc-1.tgz and a/kernel-modules-2.4.27-sparc-1.tgz all new 2.4.27
a/silo-1.4.5-sparc-2.tgz fixup siloconfig - we use /vmlinux not vmlinuz
a/aaa_elflibs-sparc-1.tgz NASTY KLUDGE - temp package until alvaro (fede2) fixes
 up the missing libraries
boot/initrd.img : many fixups - add sbin/rpc.portmap, take out SeTkernel ....
tftpboot : updated tftpconfig, delete old files, new sun4u image
YAY - we now have a working installer - 64 bit and tftpboot only - but going forward.

a/silo-1.4.5-sparc-2.tgz: Upgraded. Fixed siloconfig to find the kernel, based
  on liloconfig code. With this fix, the installer is _almost_ ready.
