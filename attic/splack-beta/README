Diffs entre slack y splack.

s/Splack/Slackware/, aunque CHOST sigue siendo sparc-slackware-linux

a/
  acpid missing. This isn't needed on sparc (right?).
  apmd missing. This isn't needed on sparc (right?).
  isapnptools missing. No ISA on sparc boxes.
  jfsutils missing. I haven't tested it yet. For now, lets just say its
   broken.
  lilo missing. Replaced by silo.
  loadlin missing. Dunno why those .exe files don't run on my sparc :)
  pcmcia-cs missing. I don't have a pcmcia box to test this. If you wanna
   gimme a tadpole box, fine with me. I will be inclueded, but untested.
  reiserfsprogs missing. I haven't tested it yet. For now, lets just say its
   broken.
  smartmontools missing (for now. I don't have box to test it).
  syslinux missing. Only for x86.
  umsdos-progs missing. For now, at least. I'm really not interested in this
   packages.
  xfsprogs missing. It's still broken on sparc. Hopefully this will change 
   soon.

   The oggutils package does not have some duplicated documentation the
    Slackware package does.
   The rpm package has been upgraded to a latter 2.4.1 version. I was
    getting extremly lazy about making this very uninteresting package, so it
    was easy for me to get this package than to spend time building it. If you
    have complains about it, please write to the splack-devel mailing list.
    As expected, the beecrypt package is added.
